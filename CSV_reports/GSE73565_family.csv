In brief, 5x106 HeLa S3 cells synchronized to either G1 or M phase were treated with 100 ug/mL cycloheximide for 5 min, harvested on ice and washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Following cell lysis and removal of nuclei by centrifugation, one tenth of the lysate was removed for total mRNA extraction and the rest was digested with 60 units RNase I (Ambion) for 45 min at room temp. Digestion was terminated with SuperaseIN (Ambion) and monosomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion. Footprint fragments were purified using a 15% polyacrylamide urea gel, and rRNA fragments were removed using Ribo-Zero Magnetic Gold Kit (Epicentre) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In parallel, mRNA was purified using Oligo (dT) cellulose (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and fragmented for 25 min at 94°C. Both mRNA and ribosome-protected fragments were dephosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and ligated to Universal miRNA Cloning Linker (NEB).
