The cell lysate was triturated 10 times through a 26G needle to insure complete lysis, incubated for 10 minutes on ice with periodic agitation, and clarified by a 10 minute centrifugation at 20,000 x g at 4°C.  The RNA concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and a SpectraMax M2 reader (Molecular Devices) according to manufacturer’s instructions.  Aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.  Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs) and fragmented total RNA depleted for ribosomal RNA were sequenced for each sample.  Footprinting was performed at room temperature for 45 min using ART-Seq Nuclease (Epicentre), then stopped with SUPERase•In™ RNase Inhibitor (Life Technologies).  For the 24 hr timepoint samples, 2.8 units of nuclease was added per µg of RNA.  For the 3 hr timepoint samples, the amount of nuclease was reduced to 0.5 units/µg.  RPFs were isolated from the nuclease/SUPERase•In™ treated lysate using Sephacryl S400 columns (GE Healthcare: MicroSpin S-400 HR, cat. no. 27-5140-01), followed by acid phenol:chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. Total RNA was isolated from untreated lysate by acid phenol:chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. Ribosomal RNA was removed from 1-5 µg of RPFs and total RNA using either the Ribo-Zero™ Magnetic or the Ribo-Zero™ Magnetic Gold Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (Epicentre). To purify the Ribo-Zero treated samples, the RNA Clean & Concentrator™-5 Kit (Zymo Research) was used as described in the ART-Seq protocol.  26-34 nt RPFs were further size selected by PAGE purification and the total RNA heat fragmented.
