GSM1712271,footprints uninfected fibroblasts, Homo sapiens,footprints uninfected fibroblasts,,Primary fibroblasts,No description available,Ribo-seq study,Elongating,"Cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation, treated with RNase I for 45min and then loaded on a sucrose cushion. RNA was then isolated from cells using the acid:phenol extraction method. Small RNA fragments were size selected via gel purification, dephosphorylated, ligated, and reverse transcribed. The resulting cDNA was circularized and PCR amplified.",{'cell type': 'Primary fibroblasts'}
