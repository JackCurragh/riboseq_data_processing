GSM1916181,Lactimidomycin treated Jurkat cells, Homo sapiens,cell line,,T Cell/ T Lymphocyte,ribosome-associated mRNA,Ribo-seq study,Elongating,"Cells were collected by centrifugation (5 min at 300g), rinsed with ice-cold PBS and recovered again by centrifugation in the presence of CHX. 108 cells were re-suspended in 1 ml ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 µg/ml CHX, 1 × complete and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) (Guo et al, 2010). Following 10 min of incubation on ice, samples were passed through QIAshredder spin columns (Qiagen). The flow-through was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g and 4°C. 600 µl of the recovered supernatant was subjected to RNase I (Life Technologies) digestion using 1000 U of enzyme. Digestion of polysomes proceeded for 55 min at room temperature and was stopped with SUPERase.In RNase Inhibitor (Life Technologies). Next, monosomes were recovered by ultracentrifugation at 75,000 RPM in a cooled TLA-120.2 rotor over a 1 M sucrose cushion in 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml CHX and 100 U/ml Superase.In. Subsequent steps were performed as described by Ingolia et al. (Ingolia et al, 2011) with some minor adjustments. RNA was extracted from the samples using a heated acid phenol; chloroform; isoamyl alcohol (125:24:1) procedure. 17 µg of RNA was subjected to electrophoresis under denaturing conditions in 15% TBE-Urea polyacrylamide gel (Life Technologies). Ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) of 28-34 nucleotides were extracted from the gel in RNase-free water for 10 min at 70°C and precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, 1.5 µl GlycoBlue (Life Technologies) and 1 volume of isopropanol overnight at − 80 °C. Following a dephosphorylation reaction (end-repair) with 10 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), the RPFs were depleted of ribosomal RNA contaminants using the Ribo-Zero Magnetic Gold Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, fragments were ligated to a 1.5 µg of Universal cloning linker using 200 U of T4 RNA ligase II (both New England Biolabs). The ligated product was size-selected using denaturing gel electrophoresis and purified from gel as described above. Subsequently, reverse transcription (RT) was performed with 200 U of SuperScript III (Life Technologies) according to (Ingolia et al, 2011), followed by a size-selection of the RT product (described above). Next, samples were subjected to circular ligation using 100 U of CircLigase (Illumina) and amplified by PCR using Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs) for 12 cycles of denaturation (10 s at 98°C), annealing (10 s of 65°C) and elongation (5 s at 72°C) using primer pairs compatible with the Illumina sequencing platform (Ingolia et al, 2011). The resulting ribosome-profiling libraries of LTM- and CHX- treated Jurkat cells were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina) to yield 75 bp single-end reads.","{'tissue': 'peripheral blood', 'cell_line': 'Jurkat T-lymphocytes', 'phenotype': 'Lymphoid-like', 'sample_type': 'cell culture', 'biomaterial_provider': 'ATCC', 'age': '14', 'Sex': 'male', 'cell_type': 'T Cell/ T Lymphocyte'}"
