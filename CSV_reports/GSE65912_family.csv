For poly-A selection, 10 μg of purified total RNA were enriched by performing two cycles of selection using the Dynabeads mRNA Purification Kit (Life Technologies). For RNA sequencing experiments, stranded libraries were prepared following the dUTP protocol (Parkhomchuk et al., 2009). In brief: ~100 ng of poly-A-selected RNA were fragmented with 10 x fragmentation buffer (Life Technologies, #AM8740) for 2 min at 70 °C. First-strand cDNA synthesis was primed with random hexamers.
