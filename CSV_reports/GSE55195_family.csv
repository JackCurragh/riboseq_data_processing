GSM1331342,"Control riboseq, replicate 1", Homo sapiens,Hek293T,,Hek293T,other,Ribo-seq study,Elongating,"Detergent lysis was performed in the dish, and after DNAse treatment sample was taken for mRNA isolation. Lysates were subjected to ribosome footprinting by RNAse I treatment. After sucrose density gradient fractionation ribosome-protected fragments were purified from 80S peak fractions. In parallel, mRNA isolated with Oligotex kit (Quiagen) was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis and fragments of the same size as ribosome protected fragments were isolated. Library preparation was carried out as described in Ingolia et al (2012),Nature Protocols","{'treatment': 'vehicle', 'rna type': 'ribosome protected fragment', 'cell line': 'Hek293T'}"
