This precise control of gene expression is achieved by complex and interlinked biochemical processes that modulate both the protein synthesis rate and stability of each individual mRNA. A major factor coordinating this regulation is the Ccr4-Not complex. Despite playing a role in most stages of the mRNA life cycle, no attempt has been made to take a global integrated view of how the Ccr4-Not complex affects gene expression. RESULTS: This study has taken a comprehensive approach to investigate post-transcriptional regulation mediated by the Ccr4-Not complex assessing steady-state mRNA levels, ribosome position, mRNA stability, and protein production transcriptome-wide. Depletion of the scaffold protein CNOT1 results in a global upregulation of mRNA stability and the preferential stabilization of mRNAs enriched for G/C-ending codons. We also uncover that mRNAs targeted to the ER for their translation have reduced translational efficiency when CNOT1 is depleted, specifically downstream of the signal sequence cleavage site. In contrast, translationally upregulated mRNAs are normally localized in p-bodies, contain disorder-promoting amino acids, and encode nuclear localized proteins. Finally, we identify ribosome pause sites that are resolved or induced by the depletion of CNOT1. CONCLUSIONS: We define the key mRNA features that determine how the human Ccr4-Not complex differentially regulates mRNA fate and protein synthesis through a mechanism linked to codon composition, amino acid usage, and mRNA localization.",Differential regulation of mRNA fate by the human Ccr4-Not complex is driven by coding sequence composition and mRNA localization.,10.1186/s13059-021-02494-w,2021 Oct 6,PMC8496106,Genome biology

Too many published studies provide insufficient detail about the bioinformatics pipeline used. The broad range of questions that can be asked with RiboSeq makes it difficult to use a single bioinformatics tool. Indeed, many scripts have been published for addressing diverse questions. Here (https://github.com/equipeGST/RiboDoc), we propose a unique tool (for use with multiple operating systems, OS) to standardize the general steps that must be performed systematically in RiboSeq analysis, together with the statistical analysis and quality control of the sample.

Cycloheximide (CHX), a widely used translation inhibitor to arrest ribosomes in these experiments, has been shown to induce biases in yeast, questioning its use. However, whether such biases are present in datasets of other organisms including humans is unknown. Here we compare different CHX-treatment conditions in human cells and yeast in parallel experiments using an optimized protocol. We find that human ribosomes are not susceptible to conformational restrictions by CHX, nor does it distort gene-level measurements of ribosome occupancy, measured decoding speed or the translational ramp. Furthermore, CHX-induced codon-specific biases on ribosome occupancy are not detectable in human cells or other model organisms. This shows that reported biases of CHX are species-specific and that CHX does not affect the outcome of ribosome profiling experiments in most settings. Our findings provide a solid framework to conduct and analyze ribosome profiling experiments.",Humans and other commonly used model organisms are resistant to cycloheximide-mediated biases in ribosome profiling experiments.,10.1038/s41467-021-25411-y,2021 Aug 24,PMC8384890,Nature communications

We discover that point mutations can simultaneously impact transcript and translation levels of the same gene. We provide evidence that functional 5' UTR mutations in the MAP kinase signaling pathway can upregulate pathway-specific gene expression and are associated with clinical outcomes.

Prior studies in Drosophila and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopamine neurons uncovered a pronounced effect of G2019S LRRK2 on mRNA translation. It was previously reported that G2019S LRRK2 promotes translation of mRNAs with complex 5' untranslated region (UTR) secondary structure, resulting in increased expression of calcium channels and dysregulated calcium homeostasis in human dopamine neurons. Here, we show that dysregulated translation occurs in the brains of mammalian LRRK2 models in vivo Through ribosome profiling studies of global translation, we observe that mRNAs with complex 5'UTR structure are also preferentially translated in the G2019S LRRK2-expressing mouse brain. Reporter assays suggest that this 5'UTR preference is independent of translation initiation factors. Conversely, translation of mRNAs with complex 5'UTR secondary structure is downregulated in LRRK2 knock-out (KO) mouse brain, indicating a robust link between LRRK2 kinase activity and translation of mRNA with complex 5'UTR structure. Further, substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopamine neurons in the G2019S LRRK2-expressing brain exhibit increased calcium influx, which is consistent with the previous report from human dopamine neurons. These results collectively suggest that LRRK2 plays a mechanistic role in translational regulation, and the G2019S mutation in LRRK2 causes translational defects leading to calcium dysregulation in the mammalian brain.",Dysregulated mRNA Translation in the G2019S LRRK2 and LRRK2 Knock-Out Mouse Brains.,10.1523/ENEURO.0310-21.2021,2021 Nov-Dec,PMC8638676,eNeuro

Genome-wide ribosome profiling in mammalian cells reveals elevated ribosome density at the start codon and surprisingly the downstream 5th codon position as well. We found that the highly focused ribosomal pausing shortly after initiation is attributed to the geometry of the exit tunnel, as deletion of the loop region from ribosome protein L4 diminishes translational pausing at the 5th codon position. Unexpectedly, the ribosome variant undergoes translational abandonment shortly after initiation, suggesting that there exists an obligatory step between initiation and elongation commitment.

Here, we uncover a dynamic translational mechanism that coordinates oncogenic HRAS-induced hyperproliferation with loss of progenitor self-renewal to restrain aberrant growth and tumorigenesis. We identify translation initiator eIF2B5 as a central co-regulator of HRAS proliferation and cell fate choice. By coupling in vivo ribosome profiling with genetic screening, we provide direct evidence that oncogene-induced loss of progenitor self-renewal is driven by eIF2B5-mediated translation of ubiquitination genes. Ubiquitin ligase FBXO32 specifically inhibits epidermal renewal without affecting overall proliferation, thus restraining HRAS-driven tumorigenesis while maintaining normal tissue growth.

Their increased energy expenditure is thought to be driven by a futile RNA cycle that reprograms metabolism to meet an increased demand for nucleotides stemming from the deregulation of RNA polymerase (pol) III transcription. Metabolic changes consistent with this model have been reported in both fasted and refed mice, however the impact of the fasting-refeeding-cycle on pol III function has not been examined. Here we show that changes in pol III occupancy in the liver of fasted versus refed wild-type mice are largely confined to low and intermediate occupancy genes; high occupancy genes are unchanged. However, in Maf1(-/-) mice, pol III occupancy of the vast majority of active loci in liver and the levels of specific precursor tRNAs in this tissue and other organs are higher than wild-type in both fasted and refed conditions. Thus, MAF1 functions as a chronic repressor of active pol III loci and can modulate transcription under different conditions. Our findings support the futile RNA cycle hypothesis, elaborate the mechanism of pol III repression by MAF1 and demonstrate a modest effect of MAF1 on global translation via reduced mRNA levels and translation efficiencies for several ribosomal proteins.",MAF1 is a chronic repressor of RNA polymerase III transcription in the mouse.,10.1038/s41598-020-68665-0,2020 Jul 20,PMC7371695,Scientific reports

SECIS-binding protein 2 (SECISBP2) increases the efficiency of this process. Pathogenic mutations in SECISBP2 reduce selenoprotein expression and lead to phenotypes associated with the reduction of deiodinase activities and selenoprotein N expression in humans. Two functions have been ascribed to SECISBP2: binding of SECIS elements in selenoprotein mRNAs and facilitation of co-translational Sec insertion. To separately probe both functions, we established here two mouse models carrying two pathogenic missense mutations in Secisbp2 previously identified in patients. We found that the C696R substitution in the RNA-binding domain abrogates SECIS binding and does not support selenoprotein translation above the level of a complete Secisbp2 null mutation. The R543Q missense substitution located in the selenocysteine insertion domain resulted in residual activity and caused reduced selenoprotein translation, as demonstrated by ribosomal profiling to determine the impact on UGA recoding in individual selenoproteins. We found, however, that the R543Q variant is thermally unstable in vitro and completely degraded in the mouse liver in vivo, while being partially functional in the brain. The moderate impairment of selenoprotein expression in neurons led to astrogliosis and transcriptional induction of genes associated with immune responses.

The CIR represses reporter mRNA deadenylation in human cells when overexpressed and inhibits CCR4-NOT and isolated CAF1 deadenylase activity in vitro. Through complementation studies in an XRN1-null cell line, we dissect the specific contributions of XRN1 domains and regions toward decay of an mRNA reporter. We observe that XRN1 binding to the decapping activator EDC4 counteracts the dominant negative effect of CIR overexpression on decay. Another decapping activator PatL1 directly interacts with CIR and alleviates the CIR-mediated inhibition of CCR4-NOT activity in vitro.

Although the presence of m(6)A in an mRNA can affect its fate in different ways, it is unclear how m(6)A directs this process and why the effects of m(6)A can vary in different cellular contexts. Here we show that the cytosolic m(6)A-binding proteins-YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3-undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro and in cells. This phase separation is markedly enhanced by mRNAs that contain multiple, but not single, m(6)A residues.

We observed thousands of AUG-initiated upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that are a major contributor to translation repression. uORF use depends on the Kozak sequence context of its start codon, and uORFs with strong contexts promote nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Transcript leaders in Cryptococcus and other fungi are substantially longer and more AUG-dense than in Saccharomyces. Numerous Cryptococcus mRNAs encode predicted dual-localized proteins, including many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, in which a leaky AUG start codon is followed by a strong Kozak context in-frame AUG, separated by mitochondrial-targeting sequence. Analysis of other fungal species shows that such dual-localization is also predicted to be common in the ascomycete mould, Neurospora crassa.

METHODS: We used Riboseq (Ribosome Profiling) to analyze transcriptome and translatome changes in the Huh-7.5 hepatocarcinoma cell line replicating HCV for 6 days. RESULTS: Established viral replication does not cause global changes in host gene expression-only around 30 genes are significantly differentially expressed. Upregulated genes are related to ER stress and HCV replication, and several regulated genes are known to be involved in HCC development. Some mRNAs (PPP1R15A/GADD34, DDIT3/CHOP, and TRIB3) may be subject to upstream open reading frame (uORF) mediated translation control. Transcriptional downregulation mainly affects mitochondrial respiratory chain complex core subunit genes.

Our results indicate significant heat-induced elevation of DMS reactivity in the global transcriptome, revealing RNA unfolding over this biological temperature range. Our parallel Ribo-seq analysis provides no evidence for a correlation between RNA unfolding and heat-induced changes in translation, in contrast to the paradigm established in prokaryotes, wherein melting of RNA thermometers promotes translation. Instead, we find that heat-induced DMS reactivity increases correlate with significant decreases in transcript abundance, as quantified from an RNA-seq time course, indicating that mRNA unfolding promotes transcript degradation. The mechanistic basis for this outcome appears to be mRNA unfolding at both 5' and 3'-UTRs that facilitates access to the RNA degradation machinery. Our results thus reveal unexpected paradigms governing RNA structural changes and the eukaryotic RNA life cycle.",Genome-wide RNA structurome reprogramming by acute heat shock globally regulates mRNA abundance.,10.1073/pnas.1807988115,2018 Nov 27,PMC6275526,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

Previous work by us and others has shown that codon identity exerts a powerful influence on mRNA stability. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, studies using a handful of reporter mRNAs show that optimal codons increase translation elongation rate, which in turn increases mRNA stability. However, a direct relationship between elongation rate and mRNA stability has not been established across the entire yeast transcriptome. In addition, there is evidence from work in higher eukaryotes that amino acid identity influences mRNA stability, raising the question as to whether the impact of translation elongation on mRNA decay is at the level of tRNA decoding, amino acid incorporation, or some combination of each. To address these questions, we performed ribosome profiling of wild-type yeast. In good agreement with other studies, our data showed faster codon-specific elongation over optimal codons and faster transcript-level elongation correlating with transcript optimality. At both the codon-level and transcript-level, faster elongation correlated with increased mRNA stability. These findings were reinforced by showing increased translation efficiency and kinetics for a panel of 11 HIS3 reporter mRNAs of increasing codon optimality. While we did observe that elongation measured by ribosome profiling is composed of both amino acid identity and synonymous codon effects, further analyses of these data establish that A-site tRNA decoding rather than other steps of translation elongation is driving mRNA decay in yeast.",Translation elongation and mRNA stability are coupled through the ribosomal A-site.,10.1261/rna.066787.118,2018 Oct,PMC6140462,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)"

Our methods reproduce the known rates from ribosome profiles generated from detailed simulations of translation.

Our analysis further reveals that a codon can exhibit up to 26-fold variability in its translation rate depending upon its context within a transcript.

The protein DHH1 links translation to mRNA stability in yeast; however, loss of the mammalian homolog, DDX6, in ESCs did not disrupt the correlation across transcripts. Instead, the loss of DDX6 led to upregulated translation of microRNA targets, without concurrent changes in mRNA stability. The Ddx6 knockout cells were phenotypically and molecularly similar to cells lacking all microRNAs (Dgcr8 knockout ESCs).

Cells cope with this challenge by coupling synthesis with polypeptide folding and by using molecular chaperones to safeguard folding cotranslationally(2). However, although most of the cellular proteome forms oligomeric assemblies(3), little is known about the final step of folding: the assembly of polypeptides into complexes. In prokaryotes, a proof-of-concept study showed that the assembly of heterodimeric luciferase is an organized cotranslational process that is facilitated by spatially confined translation of the subunits encoded on a polycistronic mRNA(4). In eukaryotes, however, fundamental differences-such as the rarity of polycistronic mRNAs and different chaperone constellations-raise the question of whether assembly is also coordinated with translation. Here we provide a systematic and mechanistic analysis of the assembly of protein complexes in eukaryotes using ribosome profiling. We determined the in vivo interactions of the nascent subunits from twelve hetero-oligomeric protein complexes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at near-residue resolution. We find nine complexes assemble cotranslationally; the three complexes that do not show cotranslational interactions are regulated by dedicated assembly chaperones(5-7). Cotranslational assembly often occurs uni-directionally, with one fully synthesized subunit engaging its nascent partner subunit, thereby counteracting its propensity for aggregation. The onset of cotranslational subunit association coincides directly with the full exposure of the nascent interaction domain at the ribosomal tunnel exit. The action of the ribosome-associated Hsp70 chaperone Ssb(8) is coordinated with assembly. Ssb transiently engages partially synthesized interaction domains and then dissociates before the onset of partner subunit association, presumably to prevent premature assembly interactions. Our study shows that cotranslational subunit association is a prevalent mechanism for the assembly of hetero-oligomers in yeast and indicates that translation, folding and the assembly of protein complexes are integrated processes in eukaryotes.",Cotranslational assembly of protein complexes in eukaryotes revealed by ribosome profiling.,10.1038/s41586-018-0462-y,2018 Sep,PMC6372068,Nature

We show that BRAF (V600E) -expressing melanoma cells are dependent on U34 enzymes for survival, and that concurrent inhibition of MAPK signalling and ELP3 or CTU1 and/or CTU2 synergizes to kill melanoma cells. Activation of the PI3K signalling pathway, one of the most common mechanisms of acquired resistance to MAPK therapeutic agents, markedly increases the expression of U34 enzymes. Mechanistically, U34 enzymes promote glycolysis in melanoma cells through the direct, codon-dependent, regulation of the translation of HIF1A mRNA and the maintenance of high levels of HIF1alpha protein. Therefore, the acquired resistance to anti-BRAF therapy is associated with high levels of U34 enzymes and HIF1alpha.

Transcripts representing 216 unique genes demonstrated a higher level of translational activity in at least one stage by exhibiting higher translational efficiencies (TEs) in which there were relatively more ribosome footprint sequence reads mapping to the transcript than were present in the control total RNA sample. The majority of these transcripts were more translationally active at the early stage of seed development and included 12 unique serine or cysteine proteases and 16 2S albumin and low molecular weight cysteine-rich proteins that may serve as substrates for turnover and mobilization early in seed development. It would appear that the serine proteases and 2S albumins play a vital role in the early stages. In contrast, our investigation of profiles of 19 genes encoding high abundance seed storage proteins, such as glycinins, beta-conglycinins, lectin, and Kunitz trypsin inhibitors, showed that they all had similar patterns in which the TE values started at low levels and increased approximately 2 to 6-fold during development. The highest levels of these seed protein transcripts were found at the mid-developmental stage, whereas the highest ribosome footprint levels of only up to 1.6 TE were found at the late developmental stage. These experimental findings suggest that the major seed storage protein coding genes are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level during normal soybean cotyledon development. Finally, our analyses also identified a total of 370 unique gene models that showed very low TE values including over 48 genes encoding ribosomal family proteins and 95 gene models that are related to energy and photosynthetic functions, many of which have homology to the chloroplast genome.

For an obligate intracellular parasite that is shielded from the cytosolic host immune factors by a parasitophorous vacuole, the brief entry into the extracellular space is likely to exert enormous stress. Due to its role in cellular stress response, we hypothesize that translational control plays an important role in regulating gene expression in Toxoplasma during the lytic cycle. Unlike transcriptional profiles, insights into genome-wide translational profiles of Toxoplasma gondii are lacking. METHODS: We have performed genome-wide ribosome profiling, coupled with high throughput RNA sequencing, in intracellular and extracellular Toxoplasma gondii parasites to investigate translational control during the lytic cycle. RESULTS: Although differences in transcript abundance were mostly mirrored at the translational level, we observed significant differences in the abundance of ribosome footprints between the two parasite stages. Furthermore, our data suggest that mRNA translation in the parasite is potentially regulated by mRNA secondary structure and upstream open reading frames.

Thus methionine may play a special role in global gene regulation. Methionine has also been known to play important roles in cell growth, development, cancer, and aging. In this work, we characterize the translational and transcriptional programs induced by methionine restriction (MetR) and investigate the potential mechanisms through which methionine regulates gene expression, using the budding yeast S. cerevisiae as the model organism. RESULTS: Using ribosomal profiling and RNA-seq, we observed a broad spectrum of gene expression changes in response to MetR and identified hundreds of genes whose transcript level and/or translational efficiency changed significantly. These genes show clear functional themes, suggesting that cell slows down its growth and cell cycle progression and increases its stress resistance and maintenance in response to MetR. Interestingly, under MetR cell also decreases glycolysis and increases respiration, and increased respiration was linked to lifespan extension caused by caloric restriction. Analysis of genes whose translational efficiency changed significantly under MetR revealed different modes of translational regulation: 1) Ribosome loading patterns in the 5'UTR and coding regions of genes with increased translational efficiency suggested mechanisms both similar and different from that for the translational regulation of Gcn4 under general amino acid starvation condition; 2) Genes with decreased translational efficiency showed strong enrichment of lysine, glutamine, and glutamate codons, supporting the model that methionine can regulate translation by controlling tRNA thiolation. CONCLUSIONS: MetR induced a broad spectrum of gene expression changes at both the transcriptional and translational levels, with clear functional themes indicative of the physiological state of the cell under MetR. Different modes of translational regulation were induced by MetR, including the regulation of the ribosome loading at 5'UTR and regulation by tRNA thiolation. Since MetR extends the lifespan of many species, the list of genes we identified in this study can be good candidates for studying the mechanisms of lifespan extension.",A global characterization of the translational and transcriptional programs induced by methionine restriction through ribosome profiling and RNA-seq.,10.1186/s12864-017-3483-2,2017 Feb 17,PMC5316152,BMC genomics

Since the N-termini of proteins often contain regulatory and targeting information, developing a robust method for start site identification is crucial. Ribosome profiling reads show distinct patterns of read length distributions around translation initiation sites. These patterns are typically lost in standard ribosome profiling analysis pipelines, when reads from footprints are adjusted to determine the specific codon being translated. RESULTS: Utilising these signatures in combination with nucleotide sequence information, we build a model capable of predicting translation initiation sites and demonstrate its high accuracy using N-terminal proteomics. Applying this to prokaryotic translatomes, we re-annotate translation initiation sites and provide evidence of N-terminal truncations and extensions of previously annotated coding sequences. These re-annotations are supported by the presence of structural and sequence-based features next to N-terminal peptide evidence. Finally, our model identifies 61 novel genes previously undiscovered in the Salmonella enterica genome.

During tumour initiation, the translational apparatus is redirected towards unconventional upstream initiation sites, enhancing the translational efficiency of oncogenic mRNAs. An in vivo RNA interference screen of translational regulators revealed that depletion of conventional eIF2 complexes has adverse effects on normal but not oncogenic growth.

We now report comprehensive ribosome profiling of a yeast cell size series from the time of cell birth, to identify mRNAs under periodic translational control. The data reveal coordinate translational activation of mRNAs encoding lipogenic enzymes late in the cell cycle including Acc1p, the rate-limiting enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase. An upstream open reading frame (uORF) confers the translational control of ACC1 and adjusts Acc1p protein levels in different nutrients. The ACC1 uORF is relevant for cell division because its ablation delays cell cycle progression, reduces cell size, and suppresses the replicative longevity of cells lacking the Sch9p protein kinase regulator of ribosome biogenesis.

To explore the contribution of translational control, RNA-seq and ribosome profiling were used to assay global transcription and translation levels of individual genes at six times over the cell cycle. Translational efficiency (TE) was used as a metric for the relative rate of protein production from each mRNA. TE profiles with similar cell cycle patterns were found across multiple clusters of genes, including those in operons or in subsets of operons. Collections of genes associated with central cell cycle functional modules (e.g., biosynthesis of stalk, flagellum, or chemotaxis machinery) have consistent but different TE temporal patterns, independent of their operon organization. Differential translation of operon-encoded genes facilitates precise cell cycle-timing for the dynamic assembly of multiprotein complexes, such as the flagellum and the stalk and the correct positioning of regulatory proteins to specific cell poles.

The question of whether those ORFs are translated was recently addressed by several groups using ribosome profiling. Most of those studies concluded that certain lncRNAs and uORFs are translated, essentially based on computational analysis of ribosome footprints. However, major discrepancies remain on the scope of translation and the translational status of individual ORFs. In consequence, further criteria are required to reliably identify translated ORFs from ribosome profiling data. RESULTS: We examined the effect of the translation inhibitors pateamine A, harringtonine and puromycin on murine ES cell ribosome footprints. We found that pateamine A, a drug that targets eIF4A, allows a far more accurate identification of translated sequences than previously used drugs and computational scoring schemes. Our data show that at least one third but less than two thirds of ES cell lncRNAs are translated. We also identified translated uORFs in hundreds of annotated coding transcripts including key pluripotency transcripts, such as dicer, lin28, trim71, and ctcf. CONCLUSION: Pateamine A inhibition data clearly increase the precision of the detection of translated ORFs in ribosome profiling experiments. Our data show that translation of lncRNAs and uORFs in murine ES cells is rather common although less pervasive than previously suggested. The observation of translated uORFs in several key pluripotency transcripts suggests that translational regulation by uORFs might be part of the network that defines mammalian stem cell identity.",Pateamine A-sensitive ribosome profiling reveals the scope of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells.,10.1186/s12864-016-2384-0,2016 Jan 14,PMC4712605,BMC genomics

We have used ribosome profiling in mouse liver to measure the translation of mRNAs into protein around the clock and at high temporal and nucleotide resolution. We discovered, transcriptome-wide, extensive rhythms in ribosome occupancy and identified a core set of approximately 150 mRNAs subject to particularly robust daily changes in translation efficiency. Cycling proteins produced from nonoscillating transcripts revealed thus-far-unknown rhythmic regulation associated with specific pathways (notably in iron metabolism, through the rhythmic translation of transcripts containing iron responsive elements), and indicated feedback to the rhythmic transcriptome through novel rhythmic transcription factors. Moreover, estimates of relative levels of core clock protein biosynthesis that we deduced from the data explained known features of the circadian clock better than did mRNA expression alone. Finally, we identified uORF translation as a novel regulatory mechanism within the clock circuitry. Consistent with the occurrence of translated uORFs in several core clock transcripts, loss-of-function of Denr, a known regulator of reinitiation after uORF usage and of ribosome recycling, led to circadian period shortening in cells.

While phosphorylated eIF2alpha (P-eIF2alpha) attenuates global protein synthesis, mRNAs encoding stress proteins are more efficiently translated. Two eIF2alpha phosphatases, containing GADD34 and CReP, catalyze P-eIF2alpha dephosphorylation. The current view of GADD34, whose transcription is stress induced, is that it functions in a feedback loop to resolve cell stress. In contrast, CReP, which is constitutively expressed, controls basal P-eIF2alpha levels in unstressed cells. Our studies show that GADD34 drives substantial changes in mRNA translation in unstressed cells, particularly targeting the secretome. Following activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), rapid translation of GADD34 mRNA occurs and GADD34 is essential for UPR progression. In the absence of GADD34, eIF2alpha phosphorylation is persistently enhanced and the UPR translational program is significantly attenuated.

Here we show that global changes in transcription and RNA processing and their impact on translation can be analysed in a single experimental setting by applying 4sU-tagging of newly transcribed RNA and ribosome profiling to lytic HSV-1 infection. Unexpectedly, we find that HSV-1 triggers the disruption of transcription termination of cellular, but not viral, genes. This results in extensive transcription for tens of thousands of nucleotides beyond poly(A) sites and into downstream genes, leading to novel intergenic splicing between exons of neighbouring cellular genes. As a consequence, hundreds of cellular genes seem to be transcriptionally induced but are not translated. In contrast to previous reports, we show that HSV-1 does not inhibit co-transcriptional splicing. Our approach thus substantially advances our understanding of HSV-1 biology and establishes HSV-1 as a model system for studying transcription termination.",Widespread disruption of host transcription termination in HSV-1 infection.,10.1038/ncomms8126,2015 May 20,PMC4441252,Nature communications

In particular, oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) during ischemia and stroke results in extensive tissue injury and cell death. RESULTS: Using time-resolved ribosome profiling, we assess gene expression levels in a neural cell line, PC12, during the first hour of OGD. The most substantial alterations are seen to occur within the first 20 minutes of OGD. While transcription of only 100 genes is significantly altered during one hour of OGD, the translation response affects approximately 3,000 genes. This response involves reprogramming of initiation and elongation rates, as well as the stringency of start codon recognition. Genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are most affected. Detailed analysis of ribosome profiles reveals salient alterations of ribosome densities on individual mRNAs. The mRNA-specific alterations include increased translation of upstream open reading frames, site-specific ribosome pauses, and production of alternative protein isoforms with amino-terminal extensions. Detailed analysis of ribosomal profiles also reveals six mRNAs with translated ORFs occurring downstream of annotated coding regions and two examples of dual coding mRNAs, where two protein products are translated from the same long segment of mRNA, but in two different frames.

We carried out ribosome profiling of cultured human cells under conditions of severe stress induced with sodium arsenite. Although this led to a 5.4-fold general translational repression, the protein coding open reading frames (ORFs) of certain individual mRNAs exhibited resistance to the inhibition. Nearly all resistant transcripts possess at least one efficiently translated upstream open reading frame (uORF) that represses translation of the main coding ORF under normal conditions. Site-specific mutagenesis of two identified stress resistant mRNAs (PPP1R15B and IFRD1) demonstrated that a single uORF is sufficient for eIF2-mediated translation control in both cases.

Convergence of these signals on eIF4F positions this factor as a gatekeeper of malignant fate. While the oncogenic properties of eIF4F have been characterized, genome-wide evaluation of eIF4F translational output is incomplete yet critical for developing novel translation-targeted therapies. RESULTS: To understand the impact of eIF4F on malignancy, we utilized a genome-wide ribosome profiling approach to identify eIF4F-driven mRNAs in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Using Silvestrol, a selective eIF4A inhibitor, we identify 284 genes that rely on eIF4A for efficient translation. Our screen confirmed several known eIF4F-dependent genes and identified many unrecognized targets of translation regulation. We show that 5'UTR complexity determines Silvestrol-sensitivity and altering 5'UTR structure modifies translational output. We highlight physiological implications of eIF4A inhibition, providing mechanistic insight into eIF4F pro-oncogenic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Here we describe the transcriptome-wide consequence of eIF4A inhibition in malignant cells, define mRNA features that confer eIF4A dependence, and provide genetic support for Silvestrol's anti-oncogenic properties. Importantly, our results show that eIF4A inhibition alters translation of an mRNA subset distinct from those affected by mTOR-mediated eIF4E inhibition.

Gliomas are also complex at the cellular level and involve multiple cell types, including transformed and reactive cells in the brain tumor microenvironment. The distinct functions of the various cell types likely lead to different requirements and regulatory paradigms for protein synthesis. Proneural gliomas can arise from transformation of glial progenitors that are driven to proliferate via mitogenic signaling that affects translation. To investigate translational regulation in this system, we developed a RiboTag glioma mouse model that enables cell-type-specific, genome-wide ribosome profiling of tumor tissue. Infecting glial progenitors with Cre-recombinant retrovirus simultaneously activates expression of tagged ribosomes and delivers a tumor-initiating mutation. Remarkably, we find that although genes specific to transformed cells are highly translated, their translation efficiencies are low compared with normal brain. Ribosome positioning reveals sequence-dependent regulation of ribosomal activity in 5'-leaders upstream of annotated start codons, leading to differential translation in glioma compared with normal brain. Additionally, although transformed cells express a proneural signature, untransformed tumor-associated cells, including reactive astrocytes and microglia, express a mesenchymal signature.

This early diverging eukaryote shows many novel features in basic biological processes, including the use of polycistronic transcription to generate all protein-coding mRNAs. Therefore we hypothesized that translational control provides a means to tune gene expression during parasite development in mammalian and fly hosts. RESULTS: We used ribosome profiling to examine genome-wide protein synthesis in animal-derived slender bloodstream forms and cultured procyclic (insect midgut) forms. About one-third of all CDSs showed statistically significant regulation of protein production between the two stages. Of these, more than two-thirds showed a change in translation efficiency, but few appeared to be controlled by this alone. Ribosomal proteins were translated poorly, especially in animal-derived parasites. A disproportionate number of metabolic enzymes were up-regulated at the mRNA level in procyclic forms, as were variant surface glycoproteins in bloodstream forms. Comparison with cultured bloodstream forms from another strain revealed stage-specific changes in gene expression that transcend strain and growth conditions. Genes with upstream ORFs had lower mean translation efficiency, but no evidence was found for involvement of uORFs in stage-regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Ribosome profiling revealed that differences in the production of specific proteins in T. brucei bloodstream and procyclic forms are more extensive than predicted by analysis of mRNA abundance.

Here, we re-approach this issue using microarrays, RNA-Seq, ribosome profiling, and other methods. By multiple methods, we find that the whi3 mutation causes a small but consistent increase in the abundance of hundreds of mRNAs, including the CLN3 mRNA. The effect on various mRNAs is roughly in proportion to the density of GCAU or UGCAU motifs carried by these mRNAs, which may be a binding site for Whi3. mRNA instability of Whi3 targets may in part depend on a 3' AU rich element (ARE), AUUUUA. In addition, the whi3 mutation causes a small increase in the translational efficiency of CLN3 mRNA. The increase in CLN3 mRNA half-life and abundance together with the increase in translational efficiency is fully sufficient to explain the small-cell phenotype of whi3 mutants. Under stress conditions, Whi3 becomes a component of P-bodies or stress granules, but Whi3 also acts under non-stress condition, when no P-bodies are visible. We suggest that Whi3 may be a very broadly-acting, but mild, modulator of mRNA stability.

However, the contribution of each mechanism in non-steady-state situations remains unclear. We monitored the impact of miR-430 on ribosome occupancy of endogenous mRNAs in wild-type and dicer mutant zebrafish embryos and found that miR-430 reduces the number of ribosomes on target mRNAs before causing mRNA decay. Translational repression occurs before complete deadenylation, and disrupting deadenylation with use of an internal polyadenylate tail did not block target repression. Lastly, we observed that ribosome density along the length of the message remains constant, suggesting that translational repression occurs by reducing the rate of initiation rather than affecting elongation or causing ribosomal drop-off.

Studies of the Escherichia coli chaperone trigger factor (TF) reveal that, though TF can interact with many polypeptides, beta-barrel outer-membrane proteins are the most prominent substrates. Loss of TF leads to broad outer-membrane defects and premature, cotranslational protein translocation. Whereas in vitro studies suggested that TF is prebound to ribosomes waiting for polypeptides to emerge from the exit channel, we find that in vivo TF engages ribosomes only after ~100 amino acids are translated. Moreover, excess TF interferes with cotranslational removal of the N-terminal formyl methionine.

In pursuit of potential links of m(5)C with mRNA translation, we performed polysome profiling of human HeLa cell lysates and subjected RNA from resultant fractions to efficient bisulfite conversion followed by RNA sequencing (bsRNA-seq). Bioinformatic filters for rigorous site calling were devised to reduce technical noise. RESULTS: We obtained ~ 1000 candidate m(5)C sites in the wider transcriptome, most of which were found in mRNA. Multiple novel sites were validated by amplicon-specific bsRNA-seq in independent samples of either human HeLa, LNCaP and PrEC cells. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated depletion of either the NSUN2 or TRDMT1 m(5)C:RNA methyltransferases showed a clear dependence on NSUN2 for the majority of tested sites in both mRNAs and noncoding RNAs. Candidate m(5)C sites in mRNAs are enriched in 5'UTRs and near start codons and are embedded in a local context reminiscent of the NSUN2-dependent m(5)C sites found in the variable loop of tRNA. Analysing mRNA sites across the polysome profile revealed that modification levels, at bulk and for many individual sites, were inversely correlated with ribosome association.

By determining in parallel the in vivo transcriptome and translatome in SMA mice, we observed a robust decrease in translation efficiency arising during early stages of disease. We provide a catalogue of RNAs with altered translation efficiency, identifying ribosome biology and translation as central processes affected by SMN depletion.

However, the molecular genetic mechanism of how brain somatic mutations in MTOR cause intractable epilepsy has remained elusive. In this study, translational profiling of intractable epilepsy mouse models with brain somatic mutations and genome-edited cells revealed a novel translational dysregulation mechanism and mTOR activation-sensitive targets mediated by human MTOR mutations that lead to intractable epilepsy with cortical malformation. These mTOR targets were found to be regulated by novel mTOR-responsive 5'-UTR motifs, distinct from known mTOR inhibition-sensitive targets regulated by 5' terminal oligopyrimidine motifs. Novel mTOR target genes were validated in patient brain tissues, and the mTOR downstream effector eIF4E was identified as a new therapeutic target in intractable epilepsy via pharmacological or genetic inhibition. We show that metformin, an FDA-approved eIF4E inhibitor, suppresses intractable epilepsy. Altogether, the present study describes translational dysregulation resulting from brain somatic mutations in MTOR, as well as the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of intractable epilepsy.",Brain somatic mutations in MTOR reveal translational dysregulations underlying intractable focal epilepsy.,10.1172/JCI127032,2019 Oct 1,PMC6763223,The Journal of clinical investigation

Convergence of these signals on eIF4F positions this factor as a gatekeeper of malignant fate. While the oncogenic properties of eIF4F have been characterized, genome-wide evaluation of eIF4F translational output is incomplete yet critical for developing novel translation-targeted therapies. RESULTS: To understand the impact of eIF4F on malignancy, we utilized a genome-wide ribosome profiling approach to identify eIF4F-driven mRNAs in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Using Silvestrol, a selective eIF4A inhibitor, we identify 284 genes that rely on eIF4A for efficient translation. Our screen confirmed several known eIF4F-dependent genes and identified many unrecognized targets of translation regulation. We show that 5'UTR complexity determines Silvestrol-sensitivity and altering 5'UTR structure modifies translational output. We highlight physiological implications of eIF4A inhibition, providing mechanistic insight into eIF4F pro-oncogenic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Here we describe the transcriptome-wide consequence of eIF4A inhibition in malignant cells, define mRNA features that confer eIF4A dependence, and provide genetic support for Silvestrol's anti-oncogenic properties. Importantly, our results show that eIF4A inhibition alters translation of an mRNA subset distinct from those affected by mTOR-mediated eIF4E inhibition. These results have significant implications for therapeutically targeting translation and underscore a dynamic role for eIF4F in remodeling the proteome toward malignancy.",Transcriptome-wide characterization of the eIF4A signature highlights plasticity in translation regulation.,10.1186/s13059-014-0476-1,2014,PMC4203936,Genome biology

Accordingly, eIF3e(+/-) mice accumulate defective mitochondria in skeletal muscle and show a progressive decline in muscle strength. Hence, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes to enhance, at the level of early elongation, the synthesis of proteins with membrane-associated functions, an activity that is critical for mitochondrial physiology and muscle health.","eIF3 Associates with 80S Ribosomes to Promote Translation Elongation, Mitochondrial Homeostasis, and Muscle Health.",10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.003,2020 Aug 20,,Molecular cell

Many tumours, however, escape by activating cellular pathways that lead to immunosuppression. One such mechanism is the production of tryptophan metabolites along the kynurenine pathway by the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which is induced by IFNgamma(3-5). However, clinical trials using inhibition of IDO1 in combination with blockade of the PD1 pathway in patients with melanoma did not improve the efficacy of treatment compared to PD1 pathway blockade alone(6,7), pointing to an incomplete understanding of the role of IDO1 and the consequent degradation of tryptophan in mRNA translation and cancer progression. Here we used ribosome profiling in melanoma cells to investigate the effects of prolonged IFNgamma treatment on mRNA translation. Notably, we observed accumulations of ribosomes downstream of tryptophan codons, along with their expected stalling at the tryptophan codon. This suggested that ribosomes bypass tryptophan codons in the absence of tryptophan. A detailed examination of these tryptophan-associated accumulations of ribosomes-which we term 'W-bumps'-showed that they were characterized by ribosomal frameshifting events. Consistently, reporter assays combined with proteomic and immunopeptidomic analyses demonstrated the induction of ribosomal frameshifting, and the generation and presentation of aberrant trans-frame peptides at the cell surface after treatment with IFNgamma. Priming of naive T cells from healthy donors with aberrant peptides induced peptide-specific T cells. Together, our results suggest that IDO1-mediated depletion of tryptophan, which is induced by IFNgamma, has a role in the immune recognition of melanoma cells by contributing to diversification of the peptidome landscape.",Anti-tumour immunity induces aberrant peptide presentation in melanoma.,10.1038/s41586-020-03054-1,2021 Feb,,Nature

Unlike many viruses, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) does suppress the host translation machinery, and the extent to which translation machinery contributes to the overall pattern of viral replication and pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we combine RNA sequencing and ribosomal profiling analyses to systematically address this question. By simultaneously examining the changes in transcription and translation along HCMV infection, we uncover extensive transcriptional control that dominates the response to infection, but also diverse and dynamic translational regulation for subsets of host genes. We were also able to show that, at late time points in infection, translation of viral mRNAs is higher than that of cellular mRNAs. Lastly, integration of our translation measurements with recent measurements of protein abundance enabled comprehensive identification of dozens of host proteins that are targeted for degradation during HCMV infection. Since targeted degradation indicates a strong biological importance, this approach should be applicable for discovering central host functions during viral infection.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 1A (EIF1A) is essential for recruitment of the ternary complex and for assembling the 43S PIC. Recurrent EIF1AX mutations in papillary thyroid cancers are mutually exclusive with other drivers, including RAS. EIF1AX mutations are enriched in advanced thyroid cancers, where they display a striking co-occurrence with RAS, which cooperates to induce tumorigenesis in mice and isogenic cell lines. The C-terminal EIF1AX-A113splice mutation is the most prevalent in advanced thyroid cancer. EIF1AX-A113splice variants stabilize the PIC and induce ATF4, a sensor of cellular stress, which is co-opted to suppress EIF2alpha phosphorylation, enabling a general increase in protein synthesis. RAS stabilizes c-MYC, an effect augmented by EIF1AX-A113splice. ATF4 and c-MYC induce expression of amino acid transporters and enhance sensitivity of mTOR to amino acid supply. These mutually reinforcing events generate therapeutic vulnerabilities to MEK, BRD4, and mTOR kinase inhibitors. SIGNIFICANCE: Mutations of EIF1AX, a component of the translation PIC, co-occur with RAS in advanced thyroid cancers and promote tumorigenesis. EIF1AX-A113splice drives an ATF4-induced dephosphorylation of EIF2alpha, resulting in increased protein synthesis. ATF4 also cooperates with c-MYC to sensitize mTOR to amino acid supply, thus generating vulnerability to mTOR kinase inhibitors.

This novel approach allows us to systematically profile the regulatory impact of a miRNA. We refer to this approach as CARP: Combined Analysis of RNA-seq and PRO-seq. We apply CARP to multiple miRNAs and show that it robustly distinguishes direct targets from downstream changes, while greatly reducing false positives. We validate our approach using Argonaute eCLIP-seq and ribosome profiling, demonstrating that CARP defines a comprehensive repertoire of targets. Using this approach, we identify miRNA-specific activity of target sites within the open reading frame. Additionally, we show that CARP facilitates the dissection of complex changes in gene regulatory networks triggered by miRNAs and identification of transcription factors that mediate downstream regulatory changes.

Ribosome profiling (RP) studies suggest that translating ribosomes are pervasive within 5' leaders across model systems. However, the significance of this observation remains unclear. To explore a role for uORF usage in a model of neuronal differentiation, we performed RP on undifferentiated and differentiated human neuroblastoma cells. RESULTS: Using a spectral coherence algorithm (SPECtre), we identify 4954 consistently translated uORFs across 31% of all neuroblastoma transcripts. These uORFs predominantly utilize non-AUG initiation codons and exhibit translational efficiencies (TE) comparable to annotated coding regions. On a population basis, the global impact of both AUG and non-AUG initiated uORFs on basal CDS translation were small, even when analysis is limited to conserved and consistently translated uORFs. However, uORFs did alter the translation of a subset of genes, including the Diamond-Blackfan Anemia associated ribosomal gene RPS24. With retinoic acid induced differentiation, we observed an overall positive correlation in translational shifts between uORF/CDS pairs. However, CDSs downstream of uORFs show smaller shifts in TE with differentiation relative to CDSs without a predicted uORF, suggesting that uORF translation buffers cell state dependent fluctuations in CDS translation. CONCLUSION: This work provides insights into the dynamic relationships and potential regulatory functions of uORF/CDS pairs in a model of neuronal differentiation.",Translation of upstream open reading frames in a model of neuronal differentiation.,10.1186/s12864-019-5775-1,2019 May 20,PMC6528255,BMC genomics

Here, we ask whether different codon usage controls gene expression programmes in self-renewing and differentiating embryonic stem cells. RESULTS: Using ribosome and transcriptome profiling, we identify distinct codon signatures during human embryonic stem cell differentiation. We find that cell state-specific codon bias is determined by the guanine-cytosine (GC) content of differentially expressed genes. By measuring the codon frequencies at the ribosome active sites interacting with transfer RNAs (tRNA), we further discover that self-renewing cells optimize translation of codons that depend on the inosine tRNA modification in the anticodon wobble position. Accordingly, inosine levels are highest in human pluripotent embryonic stem cells. This effect is conserved in mice and is independent of the differentiation stimulus.

We further deduced the protein functions by the assays of translation efficiency, RNA folding and intracellular localizations. As the new protein UBAP1-AST6 is localized in the nucleoli and is preferentially expressed by lung cancer cell lines, we biologically verified that it has a function associated with cell proliferation. In sum, we experimentally evidenced a hidden human functional proteome encoded by purported lncRNAs, suggesting a resource for annotating new human proteins.",A hidden human proteome encoded by 'non-coding' genes.,10.1093/nar/gkz646,2019 Sep 5,PMC6735797,Nucleic acids research

Up-regulation of the tRNA cognate to the mutated codon counteracts the effects of the sSNP and rescues protein conformation and function.

This early diverging eukaryote shows many novel features in basic biological processes, including the use of polycistronic transcription to generate all protein-coding mRNAs. Therefore we hypothesized that translational control provides a means to tune gene expression during parasite development in mammalian and fly hosts. RESULTS: We used ribosome profiling to examine genome-wide protein synthesis in animal-derived slender bloodstream forms and cultured procyclic (insect midgut) forms. About one-third of all CDSs showed statistically significant regulation of protein production between the two stages. Of these, more than two-thirds showed a change in translation efficiency, but few appeared to be controlled by this alone. Ribosomal proteins were translated poorly, especially in animal-derived parasites. A disproportionate number of metabolic enzymes were up-regulated at the mRNA level in procyclic forms, as were variant surface glycoproteins in bloodstream forms. Comparison with cultured bloodstream forms from another strain revealed stage-specific changes in gene expression that transcend strain and growth conditions. Genes with upstream ORFs had lower mean translation efficiency, but no evidence was found for involvement of uORFs in stage-regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Ribosome profiling revealed that differences in the production of specific proteins in T. brucei bloodstream and procyclic forms are more extensive than predicted by analysis of mRNA abundance. While in vivo and in vitro derived bloodstream forms from different strains are more similar to one another than to procyclic forms, they showed many differences at both the mRNA and protein production level.",Extensive stage-regulation of translation revealed by ribosome profiling of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1186/1471-2164-15-911,2014 Oct 20,PMC4210626,BMC genomics

Here we used a systems approach by combining polysome mRNA profiling and bioinformatics to identify RNA-binding motifs in mRNAs that either enter or exit the polysome pool during mouse oocyte maturation. Association of mRNA with the polysomes correlates with active translation. Using this strategy, we identified highly specific patterns of mRNA recruitment to the polysomes that are synchronized with the cell cycle. A large number of the mRNAs recovered with translating ribosomes contain motifs for the RNA-binding proteins DAZL (deleted in azoospermia-like) and CPEB (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein). Although a Dazl role in early germ cell development is well established, no function has been described during oocyte-to-embryo transition. We demonstrate that CPEB1 regulates Dazl post-transcriptionally, and that DAZL is essential for meiotic maturation and embryonic cleavage. In the absence of DAZL synthesis, the meiotic spindle fails to form due to disorganization of meiotic microtubules. Therefore, Cpeb1 and Dazl function in a progressive, self-reinforcing pathway to promote oocyte maturation and early embryonic development.",Genome-wide analysis of translation reveals a critical role for deleted in azoospermia-like (Dazl) at the oocyte-to-zygote transition.,10.1101/gad.2028911,2011 Apr 1,PMC3070937,Genes & development

Previous studies showed that 5-FU modulates RNA metabolism and mRNA expression. In addition, it has been reported that 5-FU incorporates into the RNAs constituting the translational machinery and that 5-FU affects the amount of some mRNAs associated with ribosomes. However, the impact of 5-FU on translational regulation remains unclear. Using translatome profiling, we report that a clinically relevant dose of 5-FU induces a translational reprogramming in colorectal cancer cell lines. Comparison of mRNA distribution between polysomal and non-polysomal fractions in response to 5-FU treatment using microarray quantification identified 313 genes whose translation was selectively regulated. These regulations were mostly stimulatory (91%). Among these genes, we showed that 5-FU increases the mRNA translation of HIVEP2, which encodes a transcription factor whose translation in normal condition is known to be inhibited by mir-155. In response to 5-FU, the expression of mir-155 decreases thus stimulating the translation of HIVEP2 mRNA. Interestingly, the 5-FU-induced increase in specific mRNA translation was associated with reduction of global protein synthesis. Altogether, these findings indicate that 5-FU promotes a translational reprogramming leading to the increased translation of a subset of mRNAs that involves at least for some of them, miRNA-dependent mechanisms.

Depletion of eIF5A enhances upstream translation within 5' UTRs across yeast and human transcriptomes, including on the MYC transcript, where this results in increased production of an N-terminally extended protein. Furthermore, ribosome profiling experiments established that the function of eIF5A as a suppressor of ribosomal pausing at sites of suboptimal peptide bond formation is conserved in human cells.

Most circRNAs are expressed in only a few cell types and at low abundance, but they are no more cell-type-specific than are mRNAs with similar overall expression levels. Although most circRNAs overlap protein-coding sequences, ribosome profiling provides no evidence for their translation. We also annotated 635 mouse circRNAs, and although 20% of them are orthologous to human circRNAs, the sequence conservation of these circRNA orthologs is no higher than that of their neighboring linear exons. The previously proposed miR-7 sponge, CDR1as, is one of only two circRNAs with more miRNA sites than expected by chance, with the next best miRNA-sponge candidate deriving from a gene encoding a primate-specific zinc-finger protein, ZNF91.

This pathway maintains the activity of the Fe-S cluster-containing ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, whose impaired function results in movement of ribosomes into 3' UTRs, where they displace exon junction complexes, abrogating NMD. Importantly, these effects extend beyond NMD substrates, with ABCE1 activity required to maintain the accessibility of 3' UTRs to diverse regulators, including microRNAs and RNA binding proteins.

BCDIN3D is an RNA modifying enzyme that methylates specific precursor microRNAs and tRNA(His). In addition to breast cancer, BCDIN3D may also be linked to metabolism, as its gene locus is associated with obesity and T2D. In order to uncover metabolic pathways regulated by BCDIN3D in cancer, we performed an unbiased analysis of the metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome of breast cancer cells depleted for BCDIN3D. Intersection of these analyses showed that BCDIN3D-depleted cells have increased levels of Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphate (F1,6-BP), the last six-carbon glycolytic intermediate accompanied by reduced glycolytic capacity. We further show that elevated F1,6-BP is due to downregulation of Aldolase C (ALDOC), an enzyme that cleaves F1,6-BP mainly in the brain, but whose high expression/amplification is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. BCDIN3D regulates ALDOC through a non-canonical mechanism involving the crucial let-7 microRNA family and its target site on the 3'UTR of ALDOC.

Here we generated a liver tumor model in transgenic zebrafish by liver-specific expression of mouse Myc using a Tet-On system. Dosage-dependent induction of Myc expression specifically in the liver was observed in our Myc transgenic zebrafish, TO(Myc), and the elevated Myc expression caused liver hyperplasia, which progressed to hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma with prolonged induction. Next generation sequencing-based transcriptomic analyses indicated that ribosome proteins were overwhelmingly upregulated in the Myc-induced liver tumors. Cross-species analyses showed that the zebrafish Myc model correlated well with Myc transgenic mouse models for liver cancers. The Myc-induced zebrafish liver tumors also possessed molecular signatures highly similar to human those of hepatocellular carcinoma. Finally, we found that a small Myc target gene set of 16 genes could be used to identify liver tumors due to Myc upregulation.

It has recently been shown that certain types of cancer cells depend on glycine, glutamine, leucine and serine metabolism to proliferate and survive. In addition, successful therapies using L-asparaginase-induced asparagine deprivation have been developed for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, a tailored detection system for measuring restrictive amino acids in each tumour is currently not available. Here we harness ribosome profiling for sensing restrictive amino acids, and develop diricore, a procedure for differential ribosome measurements of codon reading. We first demonstrate the functionality and constraints of diricore using metabolic inhibitors and nutrient deprivation assays. Notably, treatment with L-asparaginase elicited both specific diricore signals at asparagine codons and high levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS). We then applied diricore to kidney cancer and discover signals indicating restrictive proline. As for asparagine, this observation was linked to high levels of PYCR1, a key enzyme in proline production, suggesting a compensatory mechanism allowing tumour expansion. Indeed, PYCR1 is induced by shortage of proline precursors, and its suppression attenuated kidney cancer cell proliferation when proline was limiting. High PYCR1 is frequently observed in invasive breast carcinoma. In an in vivo model system of this tumour, we also uncover signals indicating restrictive proline. We further show that CRISPR-mediated knockout of PYCR1 impedes tumorigenic growth in this system. Thus, diricore has the potential to reveal unknown amino acid deficiencies, vulnerabilities that can be used to target key metabolic pathways for cancer treatment.",Tumour-specific proline vulnerability uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading.,10.1038/nature16982,2016 Feb 25,,Nature

We performed an unbiased next-generation RNA-sequencing approach to identify commonalities or differences of the effect of HIV, HCV, and HBV viremia on NK cell transcriptomes. Using cell sorting, we obtained CD3(-) CD56(+) NK cells from blood of 6 HIV-, 8 HCV-, and 32 HBV-infected patients without treatment. After library preparation and sequencing, we used an in-house analytic pipeline to compare expression levels with matched healthy controls. In NK cells from HIV-, HCV-, and HBV-infected patients, transcriptome analysis identified 272, 53, and 56 differentially expressed genes, respectively (fold change, >1.5; q-value, 0.2). Interferon-stimulated genes were induced in NK cells from HIV/HCV patients, but not during HBV infection. HIV viremia downregulated ribosome assembly genes in NK cells. In HBV-infected patients, viral load and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) variation had little effect on genes related to NK effector function. In conclusion, we compare, for the first time, NK cell transcripts of viremic HIV, HCV, and HBV patients. We clearly demonstrate distinctive NK cell gene signatures in three different populations, suggestive for a different degree of functional alterations of the NK cell compartment compared to healthy individuals.IMPORTANCE Three viruses exist that can result in persistently high viral loads in immunocompetent humans: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus. In the last decades, by using flow cytometry and in vitro assays on NK cells from patients with these types of infections, several impairments have been established, particularly during and possibly contributing to HIV viremia. However, the background of NK cell impairments in viremic patients is not well understood. In this study, we describe the NK cell transcriptomes of patients with high viral loads of different etiologies. We clearly demonstrate distinctive NK cell gene signatures with regard to interferon-stimulated gene induction and the expression of genes coding for activation markers or proteins involved in cytotoxic action, as well immunological genes. This study provides important details necessary to uncover the origin of functional and phenotypical differences between viremic patients and healthy subjects and provides many leads that can be confirmed using future in vitro manipulation experiments.","Persistent Replication of HIV, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and HBV Results in Distinct Gene Expression Profiles by Human NK Cells.",10.1128/JVI.00575-18,2019 May 1,PMC6475777,Journal of virology

Functional interactions between some PD genes, like PINK1 and parkin, have been identified, but whether other ones interact remains elusive. Here we report an unexpected genetic interaction between two PD genes, VPS35 and EIF4G1. We provide evidence that EIF4G1 upregulation causes defects associated with protein misfolding. Expression of a sortilin protein rescues these defects, downstream of VPS35, suggesting a potential role for sortilins in PD. We also show interactions between VPS35, EIF4G1, and alpha-synuclein, a protein with a key role in PD. We extend our findings from yeast to an animal model and show that these interactions are conserved in neurons and in transgenic mice. Our studies reveal unexpected genetic and functional interactions between two seemingly unrelated PD genes and functionally connect them to alpha-synuclein pathobiology in yeast, worms, and mouse. Finally, we provide a resource of candidate PD genes for future interrogation.

The most recently acquired human ERV is HERVK(HML-2), which repeatedly infected the primate lineage both before and after the divergence of the human and chimpanzee common ancestor. Unlike most other human ERVs, HERVK retained multiple copies of intact open reading frames encoding retroviral proteins. However, HERVK is transcriptionally silenced by the host, with the exception of in certain pathological contexts such as germ-cell tumours, melanoma or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Here we demonstrate that DNA hypomethylation at long terminal repeat elements representing the most recent genomic integrations, together with transactivation by OCT4 (also known as POU5F1), synergistically facilitate HERVK expression. Consequently, HERVK is transcribed during normal human embryogenesis, beginning with embryonic genome activation at the eight-cell stage, continuing through the emergence of epiblast cells in preimplantation blastocysts, and ceasing during human embryonic stem cell derivation from blastocyst outgrowths. Remarkably, we detected HERVK viral-like particles and Gag proteins in human blastocysts, indicating that early human development proceeds in the presence of retroviral products. We further show that overexpression of one such product, the HERVK accessory protein Rec, in a pluripotent cell line is sufficient to increase IFITM1 levels on the cell surface and inhibit viral infection, suggesting at least one mechanism through which HERVK can induce viral restriction pathways in early embryonic cells. Moreover, Rec directly binds a subset of cellular RNAs and modulates their ribosome occupancy, indicating that complex interactions between retroviral proteins and host factors can fine-tune pathways of early human development.",Intrinsic retroviral reactivation in human preimplantation embryos and pluripotent cells.,10.1038/nature14308,2015 Jun 11,PMC4503379,Nature

Despite being implicated in several facets of RNA metabolism, the nature and scope of DDX3's interactions with RNA remain unclear. Here, we show DDX3 collaborates extensively with the translation initiation machinery through direct binding to 5'UTRs of nearly all coding RNAs, specific sites on the 18S rRNA, and multiple components of the translation initiation complex. Impairment of translation initiation is also evident in primary medulloblastomas harboring mutations in DDX3X, further highlighting DDX3's role in this process. Arsenite-induced stress shifts DDX3 binding from the 5'UTR into the coding region of mRNAs concomitant with a general reduction of translation, and both the shift of DDX3 on mRNA and decreased translation are blunted by expression of a catalytically-impaired, medulloblastoma-associated DDX3R534H variant. Furthermore, despite the global repression of translation induced by arsenite, translation is preserved on select genes involved in chromatin organization in DDX3R534H-expressing cells. Thus, DDX3 interacts extensively with RNA and ribosomal machinery to help remodel the translation landscape in response to stress, while cancer-related DDX3 variants adapt this response to selectively preserve translation.",Medulloblastoma-associated DDX3 variant selectively alters the translational response to stress.,10.18632/oncotarget.8612,2016 May 10,PMC5053718,Oncotarget

Here, we treat cancer cells with subtherapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multiscale, molecular snapshot of this ""AKT(low)"" cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously upregulate a host of other proteins and metabolites posttranscriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication.",AKT Inhibition Promotes Nonautonomous Cancer Cell Survival.,10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0414,2016 Jan,PMC4707053,Molecular cancer therapeutics

Here, we simulate this pro-oncogenic state by overexpressing eIF4E, the rate-limiting component of eIF4F, in primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and examine the resultant changes in cell biology and gene expression profiles of total and polyribosome-bound mRNA genome wide. Overexpressed eIF4E rescues primary HMECs from telomere-independent growth arrest and disables checkpoints governing S-phase entry as well as apoptosis in HMECs immortalized by telomerase, imparting cells with proliferative and survival autonomy. Although the transcriptional response to increased eIF4E was modest, the translational response was large, selective, and bidirectional. In addition to translational activation of known and novel eIF4E-responsive oncogenic drivers regulating cell growth and survival, our data unveil previously unrecognized cellular defenses including translational activation of tumor suppressors, translational repression of transcripts enriched with miRNA target sites, and translational modulation of genes governing translation itself. These findings provide insight into the proneoplastic and compensatory mechanisms embedded in the oncogenic translational program. They support a model whereby deregulated eIF4E moves human epithelial cells along the cancer pathway by profoundly altering ribosomal recruitment to cancer-related transcripts, and eIF4E-modified cells counter these potentially oncogenic alterations with a compensatory translational mechanism that mitigates acquisition of malignancy.",Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E induced progression of primary human mammary epithelial cells along the cancer pathway is associated with targeted translational deregulation of oncogenic drivers and inhibitors.,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0752,2007 Jul 15,,Cancer research

Being the most prevalent internal modification in mRNA, the N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) mRNA modification is as an important post-transcriptional mechanism of gene regulation(2-4) and has crucial roles in various normal and pathological processes(5-12). However, it is unclear how m(6)A is specifically and dynamically deposited in the transcriptome. Here we report that histone H3 trimethylation at Lys36 (H3K36me3), a marker for transcription elongation, guides m(6)A deposition globally. We show that m(6)A modifications are enriched in the vicinity of H3K36me3 peaks, and are reduced globally when cellular H3K36me3 is depleted. Mechanistically, H3K36me3 is recognized and bound directly by METTL14, a crucial component of the m(6)A methyltransferase complex (MTC), which in turn facilitates the binding of the m(6)A MTC to adjacent RNA polymerase II, thereby delivering the m(6)A MTC to actively transcribed nascent RNAs to deposit m(6)A co-transcriptionally. In mouse embryonic stem cells, phenocopying METTL14 knockdown, H3K36me3 depletion also markedly reduces m(6)A abundance transcriptome-wide and in pluripotency transcripts, resulting in increased cell stemness. Collectively, our studies reveal the important roles of H3K36me3 and METTL14 in determining specific and dynamic deposition of m(6)A in mRNA, and uncover another layer of gene expression regulation that involves crosstalk between histone modification and RNA methylation.",Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 guides m(6)A RNA modification co-transcriptionally.,10.1038/s41586-019-1016-7,2019 Mar,PMC6438714,Nature

The remaining 15 �l (typically slightly more than 1�g) was used in the following reverse transcription step. For each sample, 1 �g of poly(A) RNA was diluted to 15 �l and mixed with 2 �l of the N6 linker oligo: 5�CAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCNNNNNN3� (100 �M) and 3 �l KCl (1M) and split between 2 x 10 �l.

There is increasing interest in targeting eIF4A1 therapeutically in cancer, thus understanding how this protein leads to the selective re-programming of the translational landscape is critical. While it is known that eIF4A1-dependent mRNAs frequently have long GC-rich 5'UTRs, the details of how 5'UTR structure is resculptured by eIF4A1 to enhance the translation of specific mRNAs are unknown. RESULTS: Using Structure-seq2 and polysome profiling, we assess global mRNA structure and translational efficiency in MCF7 cells, with and without eIF4A inhibition with hippuristanol. We find that eIF4A inhibition does not lead to global increases in 5'UTR structure, but rather it leads to 5'UTR remodeling, with localized gains and losses of structure. The degree of these localized structural changes is associated with 5'UTR length, meaning that eIF4A-dependent mRNAs have greater localized gains of structure due to their increased 5'UTR length. However, it is not solely increased localized structure that causes eIF4A-dependency but the position of the structured regions, as these structured elements are located predominantly at the 3' end of the 5'UTR. CONCLUSIONS: By measuring changes in RNA structure following eIF4A inhibition, we show that eIF4A remodels local 5'UTR structures. The location of these structural elements ultimately determines the dependency on eIF4A, with increased structure just upstream of the CDS being the major limiting factor in translation, which is overcome by eIF4A activity.",mRNA structural elements immediately upstream of the start codon dictate dependence upon eIF4A helicase activity.,10.1186/s13059-019-1901-2,2019 Dec 30,PMC6936103,Genome biology

All Dhh1-dependent mRNAs, viral and cellular, share key common features. First, they contain long and highly structured CDSs, including a region located around nucleotide 70 after the translation initiation site; second, they are directly bound by Dhh1 with a specific binding distribution; and third, complementary experimental approaches suggest that they are activated by Dhh1 at the translation initiation step.

BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor with known functions in DNA repair, transcription regulation, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrate that BRCA1 is also a translational regulator. We previously showed that BRCA1 was implicated in translation regulation. Here, we asked whether translational control could be a novel function of BRCA1 that contributes to its tumor suppressive activity. A combination of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, microarray analysis, and polysome profiling, was used to identify the mRNAs that were specifically deregulated under BRCA1 deficiency. Western blot analysis allowed us to confirm at the protein level the deregulated translation of a subset of mRNAs. A unique and dedicated cohort of patients with documented germ-line BRCA1 pathogenic variant statues was set up, and tissue microarrays with the biopsies of these patients were constructed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry for their content in each candidate protein. Here, we show that BRCA1 translationally regulates a subset of mRNAs with which it associates. These mRNAs code for proteins involved in major programs in cancer. Accordingly, the level of these key proteins is correlated with BRCA1 status in breast cancer cell lines and in patient breast tumors. ADAT2, one of these key proteins, is proposed as a predictive biomarker of efficacy of treatments recently recommended to patients with BRCA1 deficiency. This study proposes that translational control may represent a novel molecular mechanism with potential clinical impact through which BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor.",Uncovering the Translational Regulatory Activity of the Tumor Suppressor BRCA1.,10.3390/cells9040941,2020 Apr 10,PMC7226996,Cells

All Dhh1-dependent mRNAs, viral and cellular, share key common features. First, they contain long and highly structured CDSs, including a region located around nucleotide 70 after the translation initiation site; second, they are directly bound by Dhh1 with a specific binding distribution; and third, complementary experimental approaches suggest that they are activated by Dhh1 at the translation initiation step.

We recently reported a novel human phenotype resulting from a mutation in the critical coding region of the HBS1L gene characterized by facial dysmorphism, severe growth restriction, axial hypotonia, global developmental delay and retinal pigmentary deposits. Here we further characterize downstream effects of the human HBS1L mutation. HBS1L has three transcripts in humans, and RT-PCR demonstrated reduced mRNA levels corresponding with transcripts V1 and V2 whereas V3 expression was unchanged. Western blot analyses revealed Hbs1L protein was absent in the patient cells. Additionally, polysome profiling revealed an abnormal aggregation of 80S monosomes in patient cells under baseline conditions. RNA and ribosomal sequencing demonstrated an increased translation efficiency of ribosomal RNA in Hbs1L-deficient fibroblasts, suggesting that there may be a compensatory increase in ribosome translation to accommodate the increased 80S monosome levels. This enhanced translation was accompanied by upregulation of mTOR and 4-EBP protein expression, suggesting an mTOR-dependent phenomenon. Furthermore, lack of Hbs1L caused depletion of Pelota protein in both patient cells and mouse tissues, while PELO mRNA levels were unaffected. Inhibition of proteasomal function partially restored Pelota expression in human Hbs1L-deficient cells. We also describe a mouse model harboring a knockdown mutation in the murine Hbs1l gene that shared several of the phenotypic elements observed in the Hbs1L-deficient human including facial dysmorphism, growth restriction and retinal deposits.

Recent studies indicate that some Alu exons have high transcript inclusion levels or tissue-specific splicing profiles, and may play important regulatory roles in modulating mRNA degradation or translational efficiency. However, the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome remains unclear and controversial. The prevailing view is that exons derived from young repetitive elements, such as Alu elements, are restricted to regulatory functions and have not had adequate evolutionary time to be incorporated into stable, functional proteins. RESULTS: We adopt a proteotranscriptomics approach to systematically assess the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome. Using RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and proteomics data from human tissues and cell lines, we provide evidence for the translational activities of Alu exons and the presence of Alu exon derived peptides in human proteins. These Alu exon peptides represent species-specific protein differences between primates and other mammals, and in certain instances between humans and closely related primates. In the case of the RNA editing enzyme ADARB1, which contains an Alu exon peptide in its catalytic domain, RNA sequencing analyses of A-to-I editing demonstrate that both the Alu exon skipping and inclusion isoforms encode active enzymes. The Alu exon derived peptide may fine tune the overall editing activity and, in limited cases, the site selectivity of ADARB1 protein products.

Knockdown, however, produced no discernible trend in target gene expression and strikingly resulted in increased expression of the highly conserved miR-96-5p, which shares an identical seed region with miR-1271-5p, suggesting the presence of feedback mechanisms that sense disruptions to miRNA levels. These findings indicate that, while bidirectional regulation of miR-1271-5p results in substantial remodeling of the neuronal transcriptome, these effects are not inverse in nature. In addition, we provide further support for the idea that destabilisation of mRNA is the predominant mechanism by which miRNAs regulate complementary mRNAs.",Characterising the Transcriptional and Translational Impact of the Schizophrenia-Associated miR-1271-5p in Neuronal Cells.,10.3390/cells9041014,2020 Apr 18,PMC7226585,Cells

It is believed that chronic infection alters host gene expression and favors HCC development. In particular, HCV replication in Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) derived membranes induces chronic ER stress. How HCV replication affects host mRNA translation and transcription at a genome wide level is not yet known. METHODS: We used Riboseq (Ribosome Profiling) to analyze transcriptome and translatome changes in the Huh-7.5 hepatocarcinoma cell line replicating HCV for 6 days. RESULTS: Established viral replication does not cause global changes in host gene expression-only around 30 genes are significantly differentially expressed. Upregulated genes are related to ER stress and HCV replication, and several regulated genes are known to be involved in HCC development. Some mRNAs (PPP1R15A/GADD34, DDIT3/CHOP, and TRIB3) may be subject to upstream open reading frame (uORF) mediated translation control. Transcriptional downregulation mainly affects mitochondrial respiratory chain complex core subunit genes. CONCLUSION: After establishing HCV replication, the lack of global changes in cellular gene expression indicates an adaptation to chronic infection, while the downregulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain genes indicates how a virus may further contribute to cancer cell-like metabolic reprogramming (""Warburg effect"") even in the hepatocellular carcinoma cells used here.",Cellular Gene Expression during Hepatitis C Virus Replication as Revealed by Ribosome Profiling.,10.3390/ijms20061321,2019 Mar 15,PMC6470931,International journal of molecular sciences

Recent genomic and biochemical studies have now expanded this view to suggest a more substantial role for the ER cellular protein synthesis. We have utilized cell fractionation and ribosome profiling to obtain a genomic survey of the subcellular organization of mRNA translation and report that ribosomal loading of mRNAs, a proxy for mRNA translation, is biased to the ER. Notably, ER-associated mRNAs encoding both cytosolic and topogenic signal-encoding proteins display similar ribosome loading densities, suggesting that ER-associated ribosomes serve a global role in mRNA translation.

RESULTS: TSC2-deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead. Transcriptome analysis indicated an active inflammatory response and increased metabolic activity, whereas at the level of translation ribosomal transcripts showed a 5'UTR motif-mediated increase in ribosome occupancy.

We hypothesized that lung stromal cells activate pathological gene expression programs that support oncogenesis.Objectives: To identify molecular mechanisms operating in the lung stroma that support the development of lung cancer.Methods: The study included subjects with and without lung cancer across a spectrum of lung-function values. We conducted a multiomics analysis of nonmalignant lung tissue to quantify the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome.Measurements and Main Results: Cancer-associated gene expression changes predominantly manifested as alterations in the efficiency of mRNA translation modulating protein levels in the absence of corresponding changes in mRNA levels. The molecular mechanisms that drove these cancer-associated translation programs differed based on lung function. In subjects with normal to mildly impaired lung function, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway served as an upstream driver, whereas in subjects with severe airflow obstruction, pathways downstream of pathological extracellular matrix emerged. Consistent with a role during cancer initiation, both the mTOR and extracellular matrix gene expression programs paralleled the activation of previously identified procancer secretomes. Furthermore, an in situ examination of lung tissue showed that stromal fibroblasts expressed cancer-associated proteins from two procancer secretomes: one that included IL-6 (in cases of mild or no airflow obstruction), and one that included BMP1 (in cases of severe airflow obstruction).Conclusions: Two distinct stromal gene expression programs that promote cancer initiation are activated in patients with lung cancer depending on lung function.

The global posttranscriptional mechanisms underlying fibroblast-to-myofibroblast conversion in the heart have not been explored. METHODS: Genome-wide changes of RNA transcription and translation during human cardiac fibroblast activation were monitored with RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling. We then used RNA-binding protein-based analyses to identify translational regulators of fibrogenic genes. The integration with cardiac ribosome occupancy levels of 30 dilated cardiomyopathy patients demonstrates that these posttranscriptional mechanisms are also active in the diseased fibrotic human heart. RESULTS: We generated nucleotide-resolution translatome data during the transforming growth factor beta1-driven cellular transition of human cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. This identified dynamic changes of RNA transcription and translation at several time points during the fibrotic response, revealing transient and early-responder genes. Remarkably, about one-third of all changes in gene expression in activated fibroblasts are subject to translational regulation, and dynamic variation in ribosome occupancy affects protein abundance independent of RNA levels. Targets of RNA-binding proteins were strongly enriched in posttranscriptionally regulated genes, suggesting genes such as MBNL2 can act as translational activators or repressors. Ribosome occupancy in the hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy suggested the same posttranscriptional regulatory network was underlying cardiac fibrosis. Key network hubs include RNA-binding proteins such as Pumilio RNA binding family member 2 (PUM2) and Quaking (QKI) that work in concert to regulate the translation of target transcripts in human diseased hearts. Furthermore, silencing of both PUM2 and QKI inhibits the transition of fibroblasts toward profibrotic myofibroblasts in response to transforming growth factor beta1. CONCLUSIONS: We reveal widespread translational effects of transforming growth factor beta1 and define novel posttranscriptional regulatory networks that control the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition. These networks are active in human heart disease, and silencing of hub genes limits fibroblast activation. Our findings show the central importance of translational control in fibrosis and highlight novel pathogenic mechanisms in heart failure.",Widespread Translational Control of Fibrosis in the Human Heart by RNA-Binding Proteins.,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.039596,2019 Sep 10,PMC6749977,Circulation

Proximity-specific ribosome profiling demonstrates that the EMC engages clients cotranslationally and immediately following clusters of TMDs enriched for charged residues. The EMC can remain associated after completion of translation, which both protects clients from premature degradation and allows recruitment of substrate-specific and general chaperones. Thus, the EMC broadly enables the biogenesis of multipass transmembrane proteins containing destabilizing features, thereby mitigating the trade-off between function and stability.",The ER membrane protein complex interacts cotranslationally to enable biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins.,10.7554/eLife.37018,2018 May 29,PMC5995541,eLife

We sought to dissect the respective contributions of translational inhibition and mRNA decay to microRNA regulation. We identified direct targets of a specific miRNA, miR-124, by virtue of their association with Argonaute proteins, core components of miRNA effector complexes, in response to miR-124 transfection in human tissue culture cells. In parallel, we assessed mRNA levels and obtained translation profiles using a novel global approach to analyze polysomes separated on sucrose gradients. Analysis of translation profiles for approximately 8,000 genes in these proliferative human cells revealed that basic features of translation are similar to those previously observed in rapidly growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For approximately 600 mRNAs specifically recruited to Argonaute proteins by miR-124, we found reductions in both the mRNA abundance and inferred translation rate spanning a large dynamic range. The changes in mRNA levels of these miR-124 targets were larger than the changes in translation, with average decreases of 35% and 12%, respectively. Further, there was no identifiable subgroup of mRNA targets for which the translational response was dominant. Both ribosome occupancy (the fraction of a given gene's transcripts associated with ribosomes) and ribosome density (the average number of ribosomes bound per unit length of coding sequence) were selectively reduced for hundreds of miR-124 targets by the presence of miR-124. Changes in protein abundance inferred from the observed changes in mRNA abundance and translation profiles closely matched changes directly determined by Western analysis for 11 of 12 proteins, suggesting that our assays captured most of miR-124-mediated regulation. These results suggest that miRNAs inhibit translation initiation or stimulate ribosome drop-off preferentially near the start site and are not consistent with inhibition of polypeptide elongation, or nascent polypeptide degradation contributing significantly to miRNA-mediated regulation in proliferating HEK293T cells. The observation of concordant changes in mRNA abundance and translational rate for hundreds of miR-124 targets is consistent with a functional link between these two regulatory outcomes of miRNA targeting, and the well-documented interrelationship between translation and mRNA decay.",Concordant regulation of translation and mRNA abundance for hundreds of targets of a human microRNA.,10.1371/journal.pbio.1000238,2009 Nov,PMC2766070,PLoS biology

While gene regulation is a multi-step process, the majority of research concerning divergence in gene regulation among primates has focused on transcription. RESULTS: To gain a comprehensive view of gene regulation, we surveyed genome-wide ribosome occupancy, which reflects levels of protein translation, in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque. We further integrated messenger RNA and protein level measurements collected from matching cell lines. We find that, in addition to transcriptional regulation, the major factor determining protein level divergence between human and closely related species is post-translational buffering. Inter-species divergence in transcription is generally propagated to the level of protein translation. In contrast, gene expression divergence is often attenuated post-translationally, potentially mediated through post-translational modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Results from our analysis indicate that post-translational buffering is a conserved mechanism that led to relaxation of selective constraint on transcript levels in humans.",Post-translational buffering leads to convergent protein expression levels between primates.,10.1186/s13059-018-1451-z,2018 Jun 27,PMC6020354,Genome biology

Although multiple studies have described the analysis of activated DCs by transcriptional profiling, recent findings indicate that mRNAs are also regulated at the translational level. A systematic analysis of the mRNAs being translationally regulated at various stages of DC activation was performed using translational profiling, which combines sucrose gradient fractionation of polysomal-bound mRNAs with DNA microarray analysis. RESULTS: Total and polysomal-bound mRNA populations purified from immature, 4 h and 16 h LPS-stimulated human monocyte-derived DCs were analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays U133 2.0. A group of 375 transcripts was identified as translationally regulated during DC-activation. In addition to several biochemical pathways related to immunity, the most statistically relevant biological function identified among the translationally regulated mRNAs was protein biosynthesis itself. We singled-out a cluster of 11 large ribosome proteins mRNAs, which are disengaged from polysomes at late time of maturation, suggesting the existence of a negative feedback loop regulating translation in DCs and linking ribosomal proteins to immuno-modulatory function. CONCLUSION: Our observations highlight the importance of translation regulation during the immune response, and may favor the identification of novel protein networks relevant for immunity. Our study also provides information on the potential absence of correlation between gene expression and protein production for specific mRNA molecules present in DCs.",Ribosomal protein mRNAs are translationally-regulated during human dendritic cells activation by LPS.,10.1186/1745-7580-5-5,2009 Nov 27,PMC2788525,Immunome research

We describe a multilayered analysis ranging from chromatin to translation-integrating chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and ribosome profiling-to understand how cisplatin confers (pre)malignant features by using a well-established ovarian cancer model of cisplatin exposure. This approach allows us to segregate the human transcriptome into gene modules representing distinct regulatory principles and to characterize that the most cisplatin-disrupted modules are associated with underlying events of super-enhancer plasticity. These events arise when cancer cells initiate without ultimately ending the program of drug-stimulated death. Using a PageRank-based algorithm, we predict super-enhancer regulator ISL1 as a driver of this plasticity and validate this prediction by using CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB inhibition (CRISPRi) and CRISPR/dCas9-VP64 activation (CRISPRa) tools.

Using platinum-resistant OVCAR-3 cells treated with the selective mTORC1/2 inhibitor INK128/MLN128, we conducted genome-wide transcription and translation studies and analyzed the effect on cell proliferation, AKT-mTOR signaling and cell survival, to determine whether carboplatin resistance involves selective mRNA translational reprogramming, and whether it is sensitive to mTORC1/2 inhibition. Gene ontology and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were used to categorize gene expression changes into experimentally authenticated biochemical and molecular networks. We show that carboplatin resistance involves increased mTORC1/2 signaling, resulting in selective translation of mRNAs involved in DNA damage and repair responses (DDR), cell cycle and anti-apoptosis (survival) pathways. Re-sensitization of ovarian cancer cell killing by carboplatin required only modest mTORC1/2 inhibition, with downregulation of protein synthesis by only 20-30%. Genome-wide transcriptomic and translatomic analyses in OVCAR-3 cells revealed that the modest downregulation of global protein synthesis by dual mTORC1/2 inhibition is associated with greater selective inhibition of DDR, cell cycle and survival mRNA translation, which was confirmed in platinum-resistant SKOV-3 cells.

So far, the activation of host translational control mechanisms by bacterial toxins, owing to specific recruitment of mRNAs, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and ncRNAs (non-coding RNAs), are far from being understood. In the present study, we characterize for the first time the changes experienced by the translational control system of host cells in response to the well-known Staphylococcus aureus alpha-haemolysin (AHL) under both sublytic and lytic conditions. By comparing variations occurring in the cellular transcriptome and translatome, we give evidence that global gene expression is primarily rewired at the translational level, with the contribution of the RBP ELAVL1 (HuR) in the sublytic response. These results reveal the importance of translational control during host-pathogen interaction, opening new approaches for AHL-induced diseases.",Global translation variations in host cells upon attack of lytic and sublytic Staphylococcus aureus alpha-haemolysin.,10.1042/BJ20150284,2015 Nov 15,,The Biochemical journal

An essential part of this technology is removal of unwanted, normally very abundant, ribosomal RNA sequences that dominate libraries and increase sequencing costs. The most effective commercial solution (Ribo-Zero) has been discontinued as a standalone product and a number of new, experimentally distinct commercial applications have emerged on the market. Here we evaluated several commercially available alternatives designed for RNA-seq of human samples and find them generally unsuitable for ribosome footprint profiling. We instead recommend the use of custom-designed biotinylated oligos, which were widely used in early ribosome profiling studies. Importantly, we warn that depletion solutions based on targeted nuclease cleavage significantly perturb the high-resolution information that can be derived from the data, and thus do not recommend their use for any applications that require precise determination of the ends of RNA fragments.",Nuclease-mediated depletion biases in ribosome footprint profiling libraries.,10.1261/rna.075523.120,2020 Oct,PMC7491325,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)"

Although certain risk factors, such as smoking status and histology, are known, our ability to predict oral cancer risk remains poor. The study objective was to determine the value of gene expression profiling in predicting oral cancer development. Gene expression profile was measured in 86 of 162 OPL patients who were enrolled in a clinical chemoprevention trial that used the incidence of oral cancer development as a prespecified endpoint. The median follow-up time was 6.08 years and 35 of the 86 patients developed oral cancer over the course. Gene expression profiles were associated with oral cancer-free survival and used to develop multivariate predictive models for oral cancer prediction. We developed a 29-transcript predictive model which showed marked improvement in terms of prediction accuracy (with 8% predicting error rate) over the models using previously known clinicopathologic risk factors. On the basis of the gene expression profile data, we also identified 2,182 transcripts significantly associated with oral cancer risk-associated genes (P value < 0.01; univariate Cox proportional hazards model). Functional pathway analysis revealed proteasome machinery, MYC, and ribosomal components as the top gene sets associated with oral cancer risk. In multiple independent data sets, the expression profiles of the genes can differentiate head and neck cancer from normal mucosa. Our results show that gene expression profiles may improve the prediction of oral cancer risk in OPL patients and the significant genes identified may serve as potential targets for oral cancer chemoprevention.",Gene expression profiling predicts the development of oral cancer.,10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-10-0155,2011 Feb,PMC3074595,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)"

It has recently been shown that certain types of cancer cells depend on glycine, glutamine, leucine and serine metabolism to proliferate and survive. In addition, successful therapies using L-asparaginase-induced asparagine deprivation have been developed for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, a tailored detection system for measuring restrictive amino acids in each tumour is currently not available. Here we harness ribosome profiling for sensing restrictive amino acids, and develop diricore, a procedure for differential ribosome measurements of codon reading. We first demonstrate the functionality and constraints of diricore using metabolic inhibitors and nutrient deprivation assays. Notably, treatment with L-asparaginase elicited both specific diricore signals at asparagine codons and high levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS). We then applied diricore to kidney cancer and discover signals indicating restrictive proline. As for asparagine, this observation was linked to high levels of PYCR1, a key enzyme in proline production, suggesting a compensatory mechanism allowing tumour expansion. Indeed, PYCR1 is induced by shortage of proline precursors, and its suppression attenuated kidney cancer cell proliferation when proline was limiting. High PYCR1 is frequently observed in invasive breast carcinoma. In an in vivo model system of this tumour, we also uncover signals indicating restrictive proline. We further show that CRISPR-mediated knockout of PYCR1 impedes tumorigenic growth in this system. Thus, diricore has the potential to reveal unknown amino acid deficiencies, vulnerabilities that can be used to target key metabolic pathways for cancer treatment.",Tumour-specific proline vulnerability uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading.,10.1038/nature16982,2016 Feb 25,,Nature

Here we describe a genome-wide screen for NMD factors that uncovers an unexpected mechanism that broadly governs 3' untranslated region (UTR)-directed regulation. The screen reveals that NMD requires lysosomal acidification, which allows transferrin-mediated iron uptake, which, in turn, is necessary for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. This pathway maintains the activity of the Fe-S cluster-containing ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, whose impaired function results in movement of ribosomes into 3' UTRs, where they displace exon junction complexes, abrogating NMD. Importantly, these effects extend beyond NMD substrates, with ABCE1 activity required to maintain the accessibility of 3' UTRs to diverse regulators, including microRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Because of the sensitivity of the Fe-S cluster of ABCE1 to iron availability and reactive oxygen species, these findings reveal an unanticipated vulnerability of 3' UTR-directed regulation to lysosomal dysfunction, iron deficiency, and oxidative stress.",Ribosome Recycling by ABCE1 Links Lysosomal Function and Iron Homeostasis to 3' UTR-Directed Regulation and Nonsense-Mediated Decay.,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107895,2020 Jul 14,PMC7433747,Cell reports

As mice carrying the hypomorphic Gata1(low) mutation, which reduces the levels of Gata1 mRNA in megakaryocytes, develop MF, we investigated whether the TPO axis is hyperactive in this model. Gata1(low) mice contained two times more Tpo mRNA in liver and TPO in plasma than wild-type littermates. Furthermore, Gata1(low) LSKs expressed levels of Mpl mRNA (five times greater than normal) and protein (two times lower than normal) similar to those expressed by LSKs from TPO-treated wild-type mice. Gata1(low) marrow and spleen contained more JAK2/STAT5 than wild-type tissues, an indication that these organs were reach of TPO-responsive cells. Moreover, treatment of Gata1(low) mice with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib reduced their splenomegaly. Also in Gata1(low) mice activation of the TPO/MPL axis was associated with a RSP14 deficiency and a discordant microarray ribosome signature (reduced RPS24, RPS26 and SBDS expression).

These changes may restrict the availability of certain amino acids for protein synthesis, which can be utilized for cancer therapy. However, little is known about the amino acid demand changes occurring during aggressive and invasive stages of cancer. Recently, we developed diricore, an approach based on ribosome profiling that can uncover amino acid limitations. Here, we applied diricore to a cellular model in which epithelial breast cells respond rapidly to TGFbeta1, a cytokine essential for cancer progression and metastasis, and uncovered shortage of leucine. Further analyses indicated that TGFbeta1 treatment of human breast epithelial cells reduces the expression of SLC3A2, a subunit of the leucine transporter, which diminishes leucine uptake and inhibits cell proliferation. Thus, we identified a specific amino acid limitation associated with the TGFbeta1 response, a vulnerability that might be associated with aggressiveness in cancer.",TGFbeta1-induced leucine limitation uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading.,10.15252/embr.201744000,2017 Apr,PMC5376977,EMBO reports

It has recently been shown that certain types of cancer cells depend on glycine, glutamine, leucine and serine metabolism to proliferate and survive. In addition, successful therapies using L-asparaginase-induced asparagine deprivation have been developed for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, a tailored detection system for measuring restrictive amino acids in each tumour is currently not available. Here we harness ribosome profiling for sensing restrictive amino acids, and develop diricore, a procedure for differential ribosome measurements of codon reading. We first demonstrate the functionality and constraints of diricore using metabolic inhibitors and nutrient deprivation assays. Notably, treatment with L-asparaginase elicited both specific diricore signals at asparagine codons and high levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS). We then applied diricore to kidney cancer and discover signals indicating restrictive proline. As for asparagine, this observation was linked to high levels of PYCR1, a key enzyme in proline production, suggesting a compensatory mechanism allowing tumour expansion. Indeed, PYCR1 is induced by shortage of proline precursors, and its suppression attenuated kidney cancer cell proliferation when proline was limiting. High PYCR1 is frequently observed in invasive breast carcinoma. In an in vivo model system of this tumour, we also uncover signals indicating restrictive proline. We further show that CRISPR-mediated knockout of PYCR1 impedes tumorigenic growth in this system. Thus, diricore has the potential to reveal unknown amino acid deficiencies, vulnerabilities that can be used to target key metabolic pathways for cancer treatment.",Tumour-specific proline vulnerability uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading.,10.1038/nature16982,2016 Feb 25,,Nature

Blocking ES6S inhibited the cap-dependent translation of mRNAs that have structured 5\' UTRs (including G-quadruplexes), many of which are involved in signal transduction and growth, but it did not affect IRES-driven translation.

To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the blood-brain barrier, we also compared the brain endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor beta-catenin (Ctnnb1). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the brain endothelium. We identified genes encoding brain endothelium-specific transcription factors (Foxf2, Foxl2, Foxq1, Lef1, Ppard, Zfp551, and Zic3) that are associated with maturation of the blood-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of Foxf2, Foxq1, Ppard, or Zic3 transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of Foxf2 and Zic3 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of blood-brain barrier differentiation markers.

Previous studies have indicated that STAU1 interacts extensively with RNA structures in coding regions (CDSs) and 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs). In particular, duplex structures formed within 3'UTRs by inverted-repeat Alu elements (IRAlus) interact with STAU1 through its double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs). Using 3' region extraction and deep sequencing coupled to ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (3'READS + RIP), together with reanalyzing previous STAU1 binding and RNA structure data, we delineate STAU1 interactions transcriptome-wide, including binding differences between alternative polyadenylation (APA) isoforms. Consistent with previous reports, RNA structures are dominant features for STAU1 binding to CDSs and 3'UTRs. Overall, relative to short 3'UTR counterparts, longer 3'UTR isoforms of genes have stronger STAU1 binding, most likely due to a higher frequency of RNA structures, including specific IRAlus sequences. Nevertheless, a sizable fraction of genes express transcripts showing the opposite trend, attributable to AU-rich sequences in their alternative 3'UTRs that may recruit antagonistic RBPs and/or destabilize RNA structures. Using STAU1-knockout cells, we show that strong STAU1 binding to mRNA 3'UTRs generally enhances polysome association. However, IRAlus generally have little impact on STAU1-mediated polysome association despite having strong interactions with the protein. Taken together, our work reveals complex interactions of STAU1 with its cognate RNA substrates. Our data also shed light on distinct post-transcriptional fates for the widespread APA isoforms in mammalian cells.",3'READS + RIP defines differential Staufen1 binding to alternative 3'UTR isoforms and reveals structures and sequence motifs influencing binding and polysome association.,10.1261/rna.076133.120,2020 Nov,PMC7566578,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)"

We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation.

Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo.

Global unbiased profiling of mRNA translational profiles in MM cells treated with or without dex revealed that dex significantly repressed eIF2 signaling, an important pathway for regulating ternary complex formation and protein synthesis. We demonstrate that dex induces the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha resulting in the translational upregulation of ATF4, a known eIF2 regulated mRNA. Pharmacologic induction of eIF2alpha phosphorylation via activation of the heme-regulated eIF2alpha kinase (HRI) induced apoptosis in MM cell lines and in primary MM cells from patients with dex-resistant disease. In addition, co-culture with marrow stroma failed to protect MM cells from apoptosis induced by targeting the eIF2 pathway. Combination therapy with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, and BTdCPU, an activator of HRI, demonstrated additive effects on apoptosis in dex-resistant cells. Thus, specific activation of the eIF2alpha kinase HRI is a novel therapeutic target in MM that can augment current treatment strategies.",The eIF2-alpha kinase HRI is a novel therapeutic target in multiple myeloma.,10.1016/j.leukres.2017.01.007,2017 Apr,PMC5354961,Leukemia research

To obtain a genome-wide perspective of the effects of radiation on gene translation, microarray analysis was done on polysome-bound RNA isolated from irradiated human brain tumor cells; to allow for a comparison with the effects of radiation on transcription, microarray analysis was also done using total RNA. The number of genes whose translational activity was modified by radiation was approximately 10-fold greater than those whose transcription was affected. The radiation-induced change in a gene's translational activity was shown to involve the recruitment of existing mRNAs to and away from polysomes. Moreover, the change in a gene's translational activity after irradiation correlated with changes in the level of its corresponding protein. These data suggest that radiation modifies gene expression primarily at the level of translation. In contrast to transcriptional changes, there was considerable overlap in the genes affected at the translational level among brain tumor cell lines and normal astrocytes. Thus, the radiation-induced translational control of a subset of mRNAs seems to be a fundamental component of cellular radioresponse.",Radiation-induced changes in gene expression involve recruitment of existing messenger RNAs to and away from polysomes.,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3459,2006 Jan 15,,Cancer research

Yet, the importance of this codon bias in regulating cell state-specific expression programmes is currently debated. Here, we ask whether different codon usage controls gene expression programmes in self-renewing and differentiating embryonic stem cells. RESULTS: Using ribosome and transcriptome profiling, we identify distinct codon signatures during human embryonic stem cell differentiation. We find that cell state-specific codon bias is determined by the guanine-cytosine (GC) content of differentially expressed genes. By measuring the codon frequencies at the ribosome active sites interacting with transfer RNAs (tRNA), we further discover that self-renewing cells optimize translation of codons that depend on the inosine tRNA modification in the anticodon wobble position. Accordingly, inosine levels are highest in human pluripotent embryonic stem cells. This effect is conserved in mice and is independent of the differentiation stimulus. CONCLUSIONS: We show that GC content influences cell state-specific mRNA levels, and we reveal how translational mechanisms based on tRNA modifications change codon usage in embryonic stem cells.",Codon usage optimization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.,10.1186/s13059-019-1726-z,2019 Jun 7,PMC6555954,Genome biology

However, it remains unclear how changes in LIN28 expression define patterns of post-transcriptional gene regulation. Here we show that LIN28 expression level is a key variable that sets the magnitude of protein translation. By systematically varying LIN28B protein levels in human cells, we discovered a dose-dependent divergence in transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy that enabled the formation of two discrete translational subpopulations composed of nearly all expressed genes. This bifurcation in gene expression was mediated by a redistribution in Argonaute association, from let-7 to non-let-7 microRNA families, resulting in a global shift in cellular miRNA activity. Post-transcriptional effects were scaled across the physiological LIN28 expression range.

An estimated 70% of mouse genes undergo antisense transcription, including myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7), which encodes molecular motor proteins for heart contraction. Here we identify a cluster of lncRNA transcripts from Myh7 loci and demonstrate a new lncRNA-chromatin mechanism for heart failure. In mice, these transcripts, which we named myosin heavy-chain-associated RNA transcripts (Myheart, or Mhrt), are cardiac-specific and abundant in adult hearts. Pathological stress activates the Brg1-Hdac-Parp chromatin repressor complex to inhibit Mhrt transcription in the heart. Such stress-induced Mhrt repression is essential for cardiomyopathy to develop: restoring Mhrt to the pre-stress level protects the heart from hypertrophy and failure. Mhrt antagonizes the function of Brg1, a chromatin-remodelling factor that is activated by stress to trigger aberrant gene expression and cardiac myopathy. Mhrt prevents Brg1 from recognizing its genomic DNA targets, thus inhibiting chromatin targeting and gene regulation by Brg1. It does so by binding to the helicase domain of Brg1, a domain that is crucial for tethering Brg1 to chromatinized DNA targets. Brg1 helicase has dual nucleic-acid-binding specificities: it is capable of binding lncRNA (Mhrt) and chromatinized--but not naked--DNA. This dual-binding feature of helicase enables a competitive inhibition mechanism by which Mhrt sequesters Brg1 from its genomic DNA targets to prevent chromatin remodelling. A Mhrt-Brg1 feedback circuit is thus crucial for heart function. Human MHRT also originates from MYH7 loci and is repressed in various types of myopathic hearts, suggesting a conserved lncRNA mechanism in human cardiomyopathy. Our studies identify a cardioprotective lncRNA, define a new targeting mechanism for ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling factors, and establish a new paradigm for lncRNA-chromatin interaction.",A long noncoding RNA protects the heart from pathological hypertrophy.,10.1038/nature13596,2014 Oct 2,PMC4184960,Nature

Healthy, germ-free HLA-B27 transgenic (Tg) rats develop chronic colitis when colonized with complex gut commensal bacteria whereas non-transgenic (nTg) rats remain disease-free. However, the role of B. theta in causing disease in Tg rats is unknown nor is much known about how gut microbes respond to host inflammation. METHODS: Tg and nTg rats were monoassociated with a human isolate of B. theta. Colonic inflammation was assessed by histologic scoring and tissue pro-inflammatory cytokine measurement. Whole genome transcriptional profiling of B. theta recovered from ceca was performed using custom GeneChips and data analyzed using dChip, Significance Analysis of Microarrays, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. Western Blots were used to determine adaptive immune responses to a differentially expressed B. theta gene. RESULTS: B. theta monoassociated Tg rats, but not nTg or germ-free controls, developed chronic colitis. Transcriptional profiles of cecal B. theta were significantly different in Tg vs. nTg rats. GSEA revealed that genes in KEGG canonical pathways involved in bacterial growth and metabolism were downregulated in B. theta from Tg rats with colitis though luminal bacterial concentrations were unaffected. Bacterial genes in the Gene Ontology molecular function ""receptor activity"", most of which encode nutrient binding proteins, were significantly upregulated in B. theta from Tg rats and include a SusC homolog that induces adaptive immune responses in Tg rats. CONCLUSIONS: B. theta induces colitis in HLA-B27 Tg rats, which is associated with regulation of bacterial genes in metabolic and nutrient binding pathways that may affect host immune responses. These studies of the host-microbial dialogue may lead to the identification of novel microbial targets for IBD therapies.",The colitis-associated transcriptional profile of commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron enhances adaptive immune responses to a bacterial antigen.,10.1371/journal.pone.0042645,2012,PMC3411805,PloS one

We find that a selective loss of arginine tRNA charging during limitation for arginine regulates translation through ribosome pausing at two of six arginine codons. Surprisingly, limitation for leucine, an essential and abundant amino acid in protein, results in little or no ribosome pausing. Chemical and genetic perturbation of mTORC1 and GCN2 signaling revealed that their robust response to leucine limitation prevents ribosome pausing, while an insufficient response to arginine limitation leads to loss of tRNA charging and ribosome pausing. Ribosome pausing decreases protein production and triggers premature ribosome termination without reducing mRNA levels.

The dependencies of mRNAs for eIF4A during initiation is contingent on the degree of secondary structure within their 5' leader region. Interest in targeting eIF4A therapeutically in cancer and viral-infected settings stems from the dependencies that certain cellular (e.g. pro-oncogenic, pro-survival) and viral mRNAs show towards eIF4A.

To investigate RNA tails at the genomic scale, we previously developed TAIL-seq, but its low sensitivity precluded its application to biological materials of minute quantity. In this study, we report a new version of TAIL-seq (mRNA TAIL-seq [mTAIL-seq]) with enhanced sequencing depth for mRNAs (by approximately 1000-fold compared with the previous version). The improved method allows us to investigate the regulation of poly(A) tails in Drosophila oocytes and embryos. We found that maternal mRNAs are polyadenylated mainly during late oogenesis, prior to fertilization, and that further modulation occurs upon egg activation. Wispy, a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase, adenylates the vast majority of maternal mRNAs, with a few intriguing exceptions such as ribosomal protein transcripts. By comparing mTAIL-seq data with ribosome profiling data, we found a strong coupling between poly(A) tail length and translational efficiency during egg activation. Our data suggest that regulation of poly(A) tails in oocytes shapes the translatomic landscape of embryos, thereby directing the onset of animal development. By virtue of the high sensitivity, low cost, technical robustness, and broad accessibility, mTAIL-seq will be a potent tool to improve our understanding of mRNA tailing in diverse biological systems.",mTAIL-seq reveals dynamic poly(A) tail regulation in oocyte-to-embryo development.,10.1101/gad.284802.116,2016 Jul 15,PMC4973296,Genes & development

We survey for candidate RNA interacting proteins that could associate with the 5'untranslated regions of the transcripts preferentially translated in breast tumour cells. We identify SRSF1, a prototypic splicing factor, to have a pervasive direct and indirect impact on translation. In a representative estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative cell line, we find that protein synthesis relies heavily on SRSF1. SRSF1 is predominantly intranuclear. Under certain conditions, SRSF1 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it associates with MYC and CDK1 mRNAs and upregulates their internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation.

For an obligate intracellular parasite that is shielded from the cytosolic host immune factors by a parasitophorous vacuole, the brief entry into the extracellular space is likely to exert enormous stress. Due to its role in cellular stress response, we hypothesize that translational control plays an important role in regulating gene expression in Toxoplasma during the lytic cycle. Unlike transcriptional profiles, insights into genome-wide translational profiles of Toxoplasma gondii are lacking. METHODS: We have performed genome-wide ribosome profiling, coupled with high throughput RNA sequencing, in intracellular and extracellular Toxoplasma gondii parasites to investigate translational control during the lytic cycle. RESULTS: Although differences in transcript abundance were mostly mirrored at the translational level, we observed significant differences in the abundance of ribosome footprints between the two parasite stages. Furthermore, our data suggest that mRNA translation in the parasite is potentially regulated by mRNA secondary structure and upstream open reading frames.

Here, we devised a multidimensional gradient approach, which systematically locates RNA components within cellular protein networks. Among a subset of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) cosedimenting with the ubiquitin-proteasome system, our approach unveiled ncRNA MaIL1 as a critical structural component of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) immune signal transduction pathway. RNA affinity antisense purification-mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) revealed MaIL1 binding to optineurin (OPTN), a ubiquitin-adapter platforming TBK1 kinase. MaIL1 binding stabilized OPTN, and consequently, loss of MaIL1 blunted OPTN aggregation, TBK1-dependent IRF3 phosphorylation, and type I interferon (IFN) gene transcription downstream of TLR4. MaIL1 expression was elevated in patients with active pulmonary infection and was highly correlated with IFN levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

Using translation elongation inhibitors and general cellular stress conditions, including amino acid starvation and UV irradiation, we show that ribosome collisions activate the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and GCN2-mediated stress response pathways. We show that the MAPKKK ZAK functions as the sentinel for ribosome collisions and is required for immediate early activation of both SAPK (p38/JNK) and GCN2 signaling pathways. Selective ribosome profiling and biochemistry demonstrate that although ZAK generally associates with elongating ribosomes on polysomal mRNAs, it specifically auto-phosphorylates on the minimal unit of colliding ribosomes, the disome.

Because the molecular pathology is highly complex and the etiology poorly understood, we employed a defined human neuronal model with a single mTOR activating mutation to dissect the disease-relevant molecular responses driving the neuropathology and suggest new targets for treatment. METHODS: We investigate the disease phenotype of TSC by neural differentiation of a human stem cell model that had been deleted for TSC2 by genome editing. Comprehensive genomic analysis was performed by RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to obtain a detailed genome-wide description of alterations on both the transcriptional and translational level. The molecular effect of mTOR inhibitors used in the clinic was monitored and comparison to published data from patient biopsies and mouse models highlights key pathogenic processes. RESULTS: TSC2-deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead. Transcriptome analysis indicated an active inflammatory response and increased metabolic activity, whereas at the level of translation ribosomal transcripts showed a 5'UTR motif-mediated increase in ribosome occupancy. Further, we observed enhanced protein synthesis rates of angiogenic growth factors. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors corrected translational alterations but transcriptional dysfunction persisted.

Consequently, they have evolved varied mechanisms to co-opt host translation for their survival. SARS-CoV-2 relies on a non-structural protein, Nsp1, for shutting down host translation. However, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing Nsp1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes are preferentially translated in the context of Nsp1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we uncovered a remarkable enrichment of 5' terminal oligo-pyrimidine (TOP) tracts among preferentially translated genes. Using reporter assays, we validated that 5' UTRs from TOP transcripts can drive preferential expression in the presence of NSP1. Finally, we found that LARP1, a key effector protein in the mTOR pathway may contribute to preferential translation of TOP transcripts in response to Nsp1 expression. Collectively, our study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by Nsp1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.",Genes with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tracts preferentially escape global suppression of translation by the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein.,10.1101/2020.09.13.295493,2021 May 25,PMC7523102,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology

It has recently been shown that certain types of cancer cells depend on glycine, glutamine, leucine and serine metabolism to proliferate and survive. In addition, successful therapies using L-asparaginase-induced asparagine deprivation have been developed for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, a tailored detection system for measuring restrictive amino acids in each tumour is currently not available. Here we harness ribosome profiling for sensing restrictive amino acids, and develop diricore, a procedure for differential ribosome measurements of codon reading. We first demonstrate the functionality and constraints of diricore using metabolic inhibitors and nutrient deprivation assays. Notably, treatment with L-asparaginase elicited both specific diricore signals at asparagine codons and high levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS). We then applied diricore to kidney cancer and discover signals indicating restrictive proline. As for asparagine, this observation was linked to high levels of PYCR1, a key enzyme in proline production, suggesting a compensatory mechanism allowing tumour expansion. Indeed, PYCR1 is induced by shortage of proline precursors, and its suppression attenuated kidney cancer cell proliferation when proline was limiting. High PYCR1 is frequently observed in invasive breast carcinoma. In an in vivo model system of this tumour, we also uncover signals indicating restrictive proline. We further show that CRISPR-mediated knockout of PYCR1 impedes tumorigenic growth in this system. Thus, diricore has the potential to reveal unknown amino acid deficiencies, vulnerabilities that can be used to target key metabolic pathways for cancer treatment.",Tumour-specific proline vulnerability uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading.,10.1038/nature16982,2016 Feb 25,,Nature

While previous studies have identified and characterized global transcriptional mechanisms important for driving this transition, as well as other virulence properties, in C. albicans and other pathogens, considerably little is known about the role of genome-wide translational mechanisms. Using ribosome profiling, we report the first global translational profile associated with C. albicans morphogenesis. Strikingly, many genes involved in pathogenesis, filamentation, and the response to stress show reduced translational efficiency (TE). Several of these genes are known to be strongly induced at the transcriptional level, suggesting that a translational fine-tuning mechanism is in place. We also identify potential upstream open reading frames (uORFs), associated with genes involved in pathogenesis, and novel ORFs, several of which show altered TE during filamentation. Using a novel bioinformatics method for global analysis of ribosome pausing that will be applicable to a wide variety of genetic systems, we demonstrate an enrichment of ribosome pausing sites in C. albicans genes associated with protein synthesis and cell wall functions. Altogether, our results suggest that the C. albicans morphological transition, and most likely additional virulence processes in fungal pathogens, is associated with widespread global alterations in TE that do not simply reflect changes in transcript levels.

Repression of these regulatory targets leads to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (>/=84%) of the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output.",Mammalian microRNAs predominantly act to decrease target mRNA levels.,10.1038/nature09267,2010 Aug 12,PMC2990499,Nature

Yet, the importance of this codon bias in regulating cell state-specific expression programmes is currently debated. Here, we ask whether different codon usage controls gene expression programmes in self-renewing and differentiating embryonic stem cells. RESULTS: Using ribosome and transcriptome profiling, we identify distinct codon signatures during human embryonic stem cell differentiation. We find that cell state-specific codon bias is determined by the guanine-cytosine (GC) content of differentially expressed genes. By measuring the codon frequencies at the ribosome active sites interacting with transfer RNAs (tRNA), we further discover that self-renewing cells optimize translation of codons that depend on the inosine tRNA modification in the anticodon wobble position. Accordingly, inosine levels are highest in human pluripotent embryonic stem cells. This effect is conserved in mice and is independent of the differentiation stimulus. CONCLUSIONS: We show that GC content influences cell state-specific mRNA levels, and we reveal how translational mechanisms based on tRNA modifications change codon usage in embryonic stem cells.",Codon usage optimization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.,10.1186/s13059-019-1726-z,2019 Jun 7,PMC6555954,Genome biology

We previously reported that approximately 800 gene transcripts are regulated following 6 wk of supervised endurance training in young sedentary males, referred to as the training-responsive transcriptome (TRT) (Timmons JA et al. J Appl Physiol 108: 1487-1496, 2010). Here we utilized this database together with data on biological variation in muscle adaptation to aerobic endurance training in both humans and a novel out-bred rodent model to study the potential regulatory molecules that coordinate this complex network of genes. We identified three DNA sequences representing RUNX1, SOX9, and PAX3 transcription factor binding sites as overrepresented in the TRT. In turn, miRNA profiling indicated that several miRNAs targeting RUNX1, SOX9, and PAX3 were downregulated by endurance training. The TRT was then examined by contrasting subjects who demonstrated the least vs. the greatest improvement in aerobic capacity (low vs. high responders), and at least 100 of the 800 TRT genes were differentially regulated, thus suggesting regulation of these genes may be important for improving aerobic capacity. In high responders, proangiogenic and tissue developmental networks emerged as key candidates for coordinating tissue aerobic adaptation. Beyond RNA-level validation there were several DNA variants that associated with maximal aerobic capacity (Vo((2)max)) trainability in the HERITAGE Family Study but these did not pass conservative Bonferroni adjustment. In addition, in a rat model selected across 10 generations for high aerobic training responsiveness, we found that both the TRT and a homologous subset of the human high responder genes were regulated to a greater degree in high responder rodent skeletal muscle.

Using genome-wide polysome profiling, we here explore mRNAs whose translational efficiencies depend on the mTOR/4E-BP1 axis in pancreatic cancer cells. We identified a functional enrichment for mRNAs encoding DNA replication and repair proteins, including RRM2 and CDC6. Consequently, 4E-BP1 depletion favors DNA repair and renders DNA replication insensitive to mTOR inhibitors, in correlation with a sustained protein expression of CDC6 and RRM2, which is inversely correlated with 4E-BP1 expression in PDAC patient samples. DNA damage and pancreatic lesions induced by an experimental pancreatitis model uncover that 4E-BP1/2-deleted mice display an increased acinar cell proliferation and a better recovery than WT animals. Targeting translation, independently of 4E-BP1 status, using eIF4A RNA helicase inhibitors (silvestrol derivatives) selectively modulates translation and limits CDC6 expression and DNA replication, leading to reduced PDAC tumor growth. In summary, 4E-BP1 expression loss during PDAC development induces selective changes in translation of mRNA encoding DNA replication and repair protein.

Automated annotation strategies rely on assumptions about protein-coding sequences (CDSs), e.g., they are conserved, do not overlap, and exceed a minimum length. However, an increasing number of newly discovered proteins violate these rules. Here we present an experimental and analytical framework, based on ribosome profiling and linear regression, for systematic identification and quantification of translation. Application of this approach to lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse dendritic cells and HCMV-infected human fibroblasts identifies thousands of novel CDSs, including micropeptides and variants of known proteins, that bear the hallmarks of canonical translation and exhibit translation levels and dynamics comparable to that of annotated CDSs. Remarkably, many translation events are identified in both mouse and human cells even when the peptide sequence is not conserved.

The METTL3-eIF3h interaction is required for enhanced translation, formation of densely packed polyribosomes and oncogenic transformation. METTL3 depletion inhibits tumorigenicity and sensitizes lung cancer cells to BRD4 inhibition.

There are controversies concerning the existence of molecular subtypes within RB1(-/-) retinoblastoma. To test whether these molecular subtypes exist, we performed molecular profiling. METHODS: Genome-wide mRNA expression profiling was performed on 76 primary human retinoblastomas. Expression profiling was complemented by genome-wide DNA profiling and clinical, histopathological, and ex vivo drug sensitivity data. FINDINGS: RNA and DNA profiling identified major variability between retinoblastomas. While gene expression differences between RB1 (+/+) MYCN(A) and RB1(-/-) tumors seemed more dichotomous, differences within the RB1(-/-) tumors were gradual. Tumors with high expression of a photoreceptor gene signature were highly differentiated, smaller in volume and diagnosed at younger age compared with tumors with low photoreceptor signature expression. Tumors with lower photoreceptor expression showed increased expression of genes involved in M-phase and mRNA and ribosome synthesis and increased frequencies of somatic copy number alterations. INTERPRETATION: Molecular, clinical and histopathological differences between RB1(-/-) tumors are best explained by tumor progression, reflected by a gradual loss of differentiation and photoreceptor expression signature. Since copy number alterations were more frequent in tumors with less photoreceptorness, genomic alterations might be drivers of tumor progression. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Retinoblastoma is an ocular childhood cancer commonly caused by mutations in the RB1 gene. In order to determine optimal treatment, tumor subtyping is considered critically important. However, except for very rare retinoblastomas without an RB1 mutation, there are controversies as to whether subtypes of retinoblastoma do exist. Our study shows that retinoblastomas are highly diverse but rather than reflecting distinct tumor types with a different etiology, our data suggests that this diversity is a result of tumor progression driven by cumulative genetic alterations. Therefore, retinoblastomas should not be categorized in distinct subtypes, but be described according to their stage of progression.",Loss of photoreceptorness and gain of genomic alterations in retinoblastoma reveal tumor progression.,10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.06.022,2015 Jul,PMC4534696,EBioMedicine

It has recently been shown that certain types of cancer cells depend on glycine, glutamine, leucine and serine metabolism to proliferate and survive. In addition, successful therapies using L-asparaginase-induced asparagine deprivation have been developed for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, a tailored detection system for measuring restrictive amino acids in each tumour is currently not available. Here we harness ribosome profiling for sensing restrictive amino acids, and develop diricore, a procedure for differential ribosome measurements of codon reading. We first demonstrate the functionality and constraints of diricore using metabolic inhibitors and nutrient deprivation assays. Notably, treatment with L-asparaginase elicited both specific diricore signals at asparagine codons and high levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS). We then applied diricore to kidney cancer and discover signals indicating restrictive proline. As for asparagine, this observation was linked to high levels of PYCR1, a key enzyme in proline production, suggesting a compensatory mechanism allowing tumour expansion. Indeed, PYCR1 is induced by shortage of proline precursors, and its suppression attenuated kidney cancer cell proliferation when proline was limiting. High PYCR1 is frequently observed in invasive breast carcinoma. In an in vivo model system of this tumour, we also uncover signals indicating restrictive proline. We further show that CRISPR-mediated knockout of PYCR1 impedes tumorigenic growth in this system. Thus, diricore has the potential to reveal unknown amino acid deficiencies, vulnerabilities that can be used to target key metabolic pathways for cancer treatment.",Tumour-specific proline vulnerability uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading.,10.1038/nature16982,2016 Feb 25,,Nature

RAMPAGE features a streamlined protocol for fast and easy generation of highly multiplexed sequencing libraries, offers very high transcription start site specificity, generates accurate and reproducible promoter expression measurements, and yields extensive transcript connectivity information through paired-end cDNA sequencing. We used RAMPAGE in a genome-wide study of promoter activity throughout 36 stages of the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster, and describe here a comprehensive data set that represents the first available developmental time-course of promoter usage. We found that >40% of developmentally expressed genes have at least two promoters and that alternative promoters generally implement distinct regulatory programs. Transposable elements, long proposed to play a central role in the evolution of their host genomes through their ability to regulate gene expression, contribute at least 1300 promoters shaping the developmental transcriptome of D. melanogaster. Hundreds of these promoters drive the expression of annotated genes, and transposons often impart their own expression specificity upon the genes they regulate. These observations provide support for the theory that transposons may drive regulatory innovation through the distribution of stereotyped cis-regulatory modules throughout their host genomes.",High-fidelity promoter profiling reveals widespread alternative promoter usage and transposon-driven developmental gene expression.,10.1101/gr.139618.112,2013 Jan,PMC3530677,Genome research

Energy stress blocks cell growth and proliferation, a critical response for survival under extreme conditions. Excessive oncogenic stress leads to p53 activation and the induction of senescence, an irreversible state of cell-cycle arrest and a critical component in the suppression of tumorigenesis. Nutrient-sensing and mitogenic cues converge on a major signaling node, which regulates the activity of the mTOR kinase. Although transcriptional responses to energy and oncogenic stresses have been examined by many gene-expression experiments, a global exploration of the modulation of mRNA translation in response to these conditions is lacking. RESULTS: We combine RNA sequencing and ribosomal profiling analyses to systematically delineate modes of transcriptional and translational regulation induced in response to conditions of limited energy, oncogenic stress and cellular transformation. We detect a key role for mTOR and p53 in these distinct physiological states, and provide the first genome-wide demonstration that p53 activation results in mTOR inhibition and a consequent global repression of protein translation. We confirm the role of the direct p53 target genes Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 in this response, as part of the broad modulation of gene expression induced by p53 activation.

Global transcriptional profiling revealed evolutionarily conserved roles for Tor1 in regulating the expression of genes involved in nitrogen starvation responses and ribosome biogenesis. Interestingly, we found that in C. albicans Tor1 plays a novel role in regulating the expression of several cell wall and hyphal specific genes, including adhesins and their transcriptional repressors Nrg1 and Tup1. In accord with this transcriptional profile, rapamycin induced extensive cellular aggregation in an adhesin-dependent fashion. Moreover, adhesin gene induction and cellular aggregation of rapamycin-treated cells were strongly dependent on the transactivators Bcr1 and Efg1. These findings support models in which Tor1 negatively controls cellular adhesion by governing the activities of Bcr1 and Efg1.

In addition, it is compatible with complex study design when covariates need to be incorporated in the analysis. Through simulation and real dataset analyses, we show that RADAR leads to more accurate and reproducible differential methylation analysis results than alternatives, which is available at https://github.com/scottzijiezhang/RADAR.",RADAR: differential analysis of MeRIP-seq data with a random effect model.,10.1186/s13059-019-1915-9,2019 Dec 23,PMC6927177,Genome biology

Total RNA sequencing was performed in parallel for the same samples.; [Treatment]'None'; [Growth]'None'; [Extraction]'Tumors and adjacent normal tissues from HCC patients were flash-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Prior to the experiments, the tissue samples were crushed into powder in an automatic cryogenic grinder (HORIBA, Freezer/Mill 6770) filled with liquid nitrogen. About 50 mg of each of the powdered samples was lysed in 400 ul of lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (PH 7.4) (Invitrogen, AM9850G), 150mM NaCl (Invitrogen, AM9760G), 5mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen, AM9530G), 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich, T8787), 0.1% NP40 (Amresco, E109), 1 mM DTT (Sigma Aldrich, 43816), 25 U/ml DNase I (Invitrogen, AM2239) and 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide (Inalco, 1758-9310). The mixture was clarified for 10 minutes at 20,000 g at 4�C. 200ul of the clarified lysate was used for purification of the RPF, which will be profiled by ribosome profiling, and 100ul of the lysate was for the total RNA sequencing in parallel.\nFor RPF, 90 Units of RNase I (Life Technologies, AM2294) for each A260 of the lysate was added to 200 ul of the supernatant and incubated at room temperature for 45 min with gentle mixing. Nuclease digestion was stopped with 15 ul of SUPERase InTM RNase Inhibitor (Life Technologies, AM2696) and chilled on ice. Ribosome-RNA complexes were purified by Sephacryl S400 spin column chromatography (GE Healthcare, 27514001). The ribosome-protected RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen, 15596018), following the manufacturer�s protocol. Then the ribosomal RNA was depleted using the RiboZero kit (Illumina; MRZH11124), following the manufacturer�s protocol, omitting the 50�C incubation step. Next, the samples were resolved in a 15% Urea gel by electrophoresis, and the fragment at 25-35 nucleotides was excised from the gel. The RNA fragments were then eluted at least 2h in 400ul Nuclease-Free Water, 40 ul of 5 M Ammonium Acetate (Invitrogen, AM9070G) and 2 ul of 10% SDS (Invitrogen, AM9823), followed by Isopropanol (Sigma Aldrich, I9030) precipitation.\nTotal RNA from the tissue samples was isolated from 100 ul of the clarified tissue lysate with Trizol (Invitrogen, 15596018), and the ribosomal RNA was then depleted using the RiboZero kit (Illumina; MRZH11124). Next, the rRNA-depleted total RNA was fragmented with PNK buffer (NEB, M0201L) at 95?C for 20min.\nBoth RPF and fragmented total RNA were cloned and amplified for next-generation sequencing with a tagging-based workflow. In brief, the RNA fragments were end repaired with T4 PNK (NEB, M0201L) and ligated with 3� adaptor, followed by cDNA synthesis, cDNA gel purification, circularization and PCR amplification20.

Methods: With a ribosome profiling procedure optimized for solid tissue samples, we profiled the translatomes of liver tumors and their adjacent noncancerous normal liver tissues from 10 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A set of bioinformatics tools was then applied to these data for the mining of novel insights into the translation shifts in HCC. Results: This is the first translatome data resource for dissecting dysregulated translation in HCC at the sub-codon resolution. Based on our data, quantitative comparisons of mRNA translation rates yielded the genes and processes that were subjected to patient specific or universal dysregulations of translation efficiencies in tumors. For example, multiple proteins involved in extracellular matrix organization exhibited significant translational upregulation in tumors. We then experimentally validated the tumor-promoting functions of two such genes as examples: AGRN and VWA1. In addition, the data was also used for de novo annotation of the translatomes in tumors and normal tissues, including multiple types of novel non-canonical small ORFs, which would be a resource for further functional studies.

From within the parasitophorous vacuole in which they reside, Toxoplasma tachyzoites secrete an arsenal of effector proteins that can reprogram host gene expression to facilitate parasite survival and replication. Gaining a better understanding of how host gene expression is altered upon infection is central for understanding parasite strategies for host invasion and for developing new parasite therapies. Here, we applied ribosome profiling coupled with mRNA measurements to concurrently study gene expression in the parasite and in host human foreskin fibroblasts. By examining the parasite transcriptome and translatome, we identified potential upstream open reading frames that may permit the stress-induced preferential translation of parasite mRNAs. We also determined that tachyzoites reduce host death-associated pathways and increase survival, proliferation, and motility in both quiescent and proliferative host cell models of infection. Additionally, proliferative cells alter their gene expression in ways that are consistent with massive transcriptional rewiring, while quiescent cells were best characterized by reentry into the cell cycle. We also identified a translational control regimen consistent with mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in quiescent cells and, to a lesser degree, in proliferative cells. This study illustrates the utility of the method for dissection of gene expression programs simultaneously in the parasite and host.IMPORTANCE Toxoplasma gondii is a single-celled parasite that has infected up to one-third of the world's population. Significant overhauls in gene expression in both the parasite and the host cell accompany parasite invasion, and a better understanding of these changes may lead to the development of new therapeutic agents. In this study, we employed ribosome profiling to determine the changes that occur at the levels of transcription and translation in both the parasite and the infected host cell at the same time. We discovered features of Toxoplasma mRNAs that suggest a means for controlling parasite gene expression under stressful conditions. We also show that differences in host gene expression occur depending on whether they are confluent or not. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ribosomal profiling to interrogate the host-parasite dynamic under a variety of conditions.",Simultaneous Ribosome Profiling of Human Host Cells Infected with Toxoplasma gondii.,10.1128/mSphere.00292-19,2019 Jun 5,PMC6553554,mSphere

We show that, unlike in humans, most Arabidopsis mitochondrial ribosome footprints measure 27 and 28 bases. We also reveal that respiratory subunits encoding mRNAs show much higher ribosome association than other mitochondrial mRNAs, implying that they are translated at higher levels. Homogenous ribosome densities were generally detected within each respiratory complex except for complex V, where higher ribosome coverage corroborated with higher requirements for specific subunits. In complex I respiratory mutants, a reorganization of mitochondrial mRNAs ribosome association was detected involving increased ribosome densities for certain ribosomal protein encoding transcripts and a reduction in translation of a few complex V mRNAs.

The life cycles of many highly pathogenic RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and Lassa virus depends on host mRNA, because viral polymerases cleave 5\'-m7G-capped host transcripts to prime viral mRNA synthesis (""cap-snatching""). We hypothesized that start codons within cap-snatched host transcripts could generate chimeric human-viral mRNAs with coding potential. We report the existence of this mechanism of gene origination, which we named ""start-snatching."" Depending on the reading frame, start-snatching allows the translation of host and viral ""untranslated regions"" (UTRs) to create N-terminally extended viral proteins or entirely novel polypeptides by genetic overprinting. We show that both types of chimeric proteins are made in IAV-infected cells, generate T cell responses, and contribute to virulence.

We previously reported that mTORC1 signaling was depressed and overall translation was reduced in RBS cells and zebrafish models for RBS. Treatment of RBS cells and zebrafish RBS models with L-leucine partially rescued mTOR function and protein synthesis, correlating with increased cell division and improved development. RESULTS: In this study, we use RBS cells to model mTORC1 repression and analyze transcription and translation with ribosome profiling to determine gene-level effects of L-leucine. L-leucine treatment partially rescued translational efficiency of ribosomal subunits, translation initiation factors, snoRNA production, and mitochondrial function in RBS cells, consistent with these processes being mTORC1 controlled. In contrast, other genes are differentially expressed independent of L-leucine treatment, including imprinted genes such as H19 and GTL2, miRNAs regulated by GTL2, HOX genes, and genes in nucleolar associated domains. CONCLUSIONS: Our study distinguishes between gene expression changes in RBS cells that are TOR dependent and those that are independent. Some of the TOR independent gene expression changes likely reflect the architectural role of cohesin in chromatin looping and gene expression. This study reveals the dramatic rescue effects of L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1 in RBS cells and supports that normal gene expression and translation requires ESCO2 function.",Improved transcription and translation with L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1 in Roberts syndrome.,10.1186/s12864-015-2354-y,2016 Jan 5,PMC4700579,BMC genomics

Here we address this issue by simultaneously profiling with microarrays the total mRNAs (the transcriptome) and the polysome-associated mRNAs (the translatome) after EGF treatment of human cells, and extending the analysis to other 19 different transcriptome/translatome comparisons in mammalian cells following different stimuli or undergoing cell programs. RESULTS: Triggering of the EGF pathway results in an early induction of transcriptome and translatome changes, but 90% of the significant variation is limited to the translatome and the degree of concordant changes is less than 5%. The survey of other 19 different transcriptome/translatome comparisons shows that extensive uncoupling is a general rule, in terms of both RNA movements and inferred cell activities, with a strong tendency of translation-related genes to be controlled purely at the translational level. By different statistical approaches, we finally provide evidence of the lack of dependence between changes at the transcriptome and translatome levels. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model of diffused independency between variation in transcript abundances and variation in their engagement on polysomes, which implies the existence of specific mechanisms to couple these two ways of regulating gene expression.",Widespread uncoupling between transcriptome and translatome variations after a stimulus in mammalian cells.,10.1186/1471-2164-13-220,2012 Jun 6,PMC3441405,BMC genomics

Recent genomic studies have reported recurrent DDX3X mutations in numerous tumors including medulloblastoma (MB), but the physiological impact of these mutations is poorly understood. Here we show that a consistent feature of MB-associated mutations is SG hyper-assembly and concomitant translation impairment. We used CLIP-seq to obtain a comprehensive assessment of DDX3X binding targets and ribosome profiling for high-resolution assessment of global translation. Surprisingly, mutant DDX3X expression caused broad inhibition of translation that impacted DDX3X targeted and non-targeted mRNAs alike. Assessment of translation efficiency with single-cell resolution revealed that SG hyper-assembly correlated precisely with impaired global translation. SG hyper-assembly and translation impairment driven by mutant DDX3X were rescued by a genetic approach that limited SG assembly and by deletion of the N-terminal low complexity domain within DDX3X. Thus, in addition to a primary defect at the level of translation initiation caused by DDX3X mutation, SG assembly itself contributes to global translation inhibition. This work provides mechanistic insights into the consequences of cancer-related DDX3X mutations, suggesting that globally reduced translation may provide a context-dependent survival advantage that must be considered as a possible contributor to tumorigenesis.",Cancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.,10.1038/srep25996,2016 May 16,PMC4867597,Scientific reports

Reversion of the invasive phenotype, however, is challenged by the poor understanding of mechanisms underlying its maintenance. Here, we report that the lncRNA TINCR is down-regulated in metastatic melanoma and its silencing increases the expression levels of invasive markers, in vitro migration, in vivo tumor growth, and resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The critical mediator is ATF4, a central player of the integrated stress response (ISR), which is activated in TINCR-depleted cells in the absence of starvation and eIF2alpha phosphorylation. TINCR depletion increases global protein synthesis and induces translational reprogramming, leading to increased translation of mRNAs encoding ATF4 and other ISR proteins. Strikingly, re-expression of TINCR in metastatic melanoma suppresses the invasive phenotype, reduces numbers of tumor-initiating cells and metastasis formation, and increases drug sensitivity. Mechanistically, TINCR interacts with mRNAs associated with the invasive phenotype, including ATF4, preventing their binding to ribosomes. Thus, TINCR is a suppressor of the melanoma invasive phenotype, which functions in nutrient-rich conditions by repressing translation of selected ISR RNAs.",Long non-coding RNA TINCR suppresses metastatic melanoma dissemination by preventing ATF4 translation.,10.15252/embr.202050852,2021 Mar 3,PMC7926219,EMBO reports

We found that the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of tyrosine aminotransferase (TATN-1)-the first enzyme involved in the metabolic degradation of tyrosine-is up-regulated in response to oxidative stress and directly activated by the oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor SKN-1. Worms deficient in tyrosine aminotransferase activity displayed increased sensitivity to multiple sources of oxidative stress. Biochemical assays revealed that m-tyrosine is a substrate for TATN-1-mediated deamination, suggesting that TATN-1 also metabolizes m-tyrosine. Consistent with a toxic effect of m-tyrosine and a protective function of TATN-1, tatn-1 mutant worms exhibited delayed development, marked reduction in fertility, and shortened lifespan when exposed to m-tyrosine. A forward genetic screen identified a mutation in the previously uncharacterized gene F01D4.5-homologous with human transcription factor 20 (TCF20) and retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1)-that suppresses the adverse phenotypes observed in m-tyrosine-treated tatn-1 mutant worms. RNA-Seq analysis of F01D4.5 mutant worms disclosed a significant reduction in the expression of specific isoforms of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, suggesting that alterations in protein synthesis or ribosome structure could diminish the adverse effects of m-tyrosine.

The oncogenic form of FLT3 is an important therapeutic target, and inhibitors specifically targeting FLT3 kinase can induce complete remission; however, relapse after remission has been observed due to acquired resistance with secondary mutations in FLT3, highlighting the need for new strategies to target FLT3-ITD mutations. Recent studies have reported that the aberrant formations of circular RNAs (circRNAs) are biological tumorigenesis-relevant mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Herein, we discovered a circRNA, circMYBL2, derived from the cell-cycle checkpoint gene MYBL2. circMYBL2 is more highly expressed in AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutations than in those without the FLT3-ITD mutation. We found that circMYBL2 knockdown specifically inhibits proliferation and promotes the differentiation of FLT3-ITD AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, we found that circMYBL2 significantly influences the protein level of mutant FLT3 kinase, which contributes to the activation of FLT3-ITD-dependent signaling pathways. Mechanistically, circMYBL2 enhanced the translational efficiency of FLT3 kinase by increasing the binding of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) to FLT3 messenger RNA. Moreover, circMYBL2 knockdown impaired the cytoactivity of inhibitor-resistant FLT3-ITD+ cells, with a significant decrease in FLT3 kinase expression, followed by the inactivation of its downstream pathways. In summary, we are the first to reveal a circRNA that specifically influences FLT3-ITD AML and regulates FLT3 kinase levels through translational regulation, suggesting that circMYBL2 may be a potential therapeutic target for FLT3-ITD AML.","circMYBL2, a circRNA from MYBL2, regulates FLT3 translation by recruiting PTBP1 to promote FLT3-ITD AML progression.",10.1182/blood.2019000802,2019 Oct 31,PMC6839953,Blood

High-throughput small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) has been widely adopted to investigate the functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs. However, accurate quantification of miRNAs has been limited owing to the severe ligation bias in conventional sRNA-seq methods. Here, we quantify miRNAs and their variants (known as isomiRs) by an improved sRNA-seq protocol, termed AQ-seq (accurate quantification by sequencing), that utilizes adapters with terminal degenerate sequences and a high concentration of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which minimize the ligation bias during library preparation. Measurement using AQ-seq allows us to correct the previously misannotated 5' end usage and strand preference in public databases. Importantly, the analysis of 5' terminal heterogeneity reveals widespread alternative processing events which have been underestimated. We also identify highly uridylated miRNAs originating from the 3p strands, indicating regulations mediated by terminal uridylyl transferases at the pre-miRNA stage. Taken together, our study reveals the complexity of the miRNA isoform landscape, allowing us to refine miRNA annotation and to advance our understanding of miRNA regulation.

Stop codon readthrough is essential to diverse viruses, and phylogenetically predicted to occur in a few hundred genes in Drosophila melanogaster, but the importance of regulated readthrough in eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a ribosome profiling assay (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) for Drosophila melanogaster, and provide the first genome-wide experimental analysis of readthrough. Readthrough is far more pervasive than expected: the vast majority of readthrough events evolved within D. melanogaster and were not predicted phylogenetically. The resulting C-terminal protein extensions show evidence of selection, contain functional subcellular localization signals, and their readthrough is regulated, arguing for their importance. We further demonstrate that readthrough occurs in yeast and humans. Readthrough thus provides general mechanisms both to regulate gene expression and function, and to add plasticity to the proteome during evolution.

This approach allows us to segregate the human transcriptome into gene modules representing distinct regulatory principles and to characterize that the most cisplatin-disrupted modules are associated with underlying events of super-enhancer plasticity. These events arise when cancer cells initiate without ultimately ending the program of drug-stimulated death. Using a PageRank-based algorithm, we predict super-enhancer regulator ISL1 as a driver of this plasticity and validate this prediction by using CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB inhibition (CRISPRi) and CRISPR/dCas9-VP64 activation (CRISPRa) tools.

We show that DAP5, an eIF4GI homolog that lacks eIF4E binding, utilizes eIF3d to facilitate cap-dependent translation of approximately 20% of mRNAs. Genome-wide transcriptomic and translatomic analyses indicate that DAP5 is required for translation of many transcription factors and receptor capped mRNAs and their mRNA targets involved in cell survival, motility, DNA repair and translation initiation, among other mRNAs. Mass spectrometry and crosslinking studies demonstrate that eIF3d is a direct binding partner of DAP5.

We reveal that TRIM71 binds targets through 3' untranslated region (UTR) hairpin motifs and that it acts predominantly by target degradation. TRIM71 mutations implicated in etiogenesis of human congenital hydrocephalus impair target silencing. We identify a set of primary targets consistently regulated in various human and mouse cell lines, including MBNL1 (Muscleblind-like protein 1). MBNL1 promotes cell differentiation through regulation of alternative splicing, and we demonstrate that TRIM71 promotes embryonic splicing patterns through MBNL1 repression.

We show that mTORC1 and mTORC2 are both required to enact DNA damage repair and cell survival, resulting in increased cancer cell survival during DNA damage.

Only mTORC1/2 inhibition reversed cancer cell resistance to DNA damage and replicative stress and increased tumor cell killing and tumor control by DNA damage therapies in animal models.

Here we used recent advances in next-generation sequencing to uncover a novel re-programming of transcript length between Hc developmental cell types. We found that ~2% percent of Hc transcripts exhibit 5' leader sequences that differ markedly in length between morphogenetic states. Ribosome density and mRNA abundance measurements of differential leader transcripts revealed nuanced transcriptional and translational regulation. One such class of regulated longer leader transcripts exhibited tight transcriptional and translational repression.

We determined the in vivo ribosome distributions at single codon resolution in yeast strains lacking mcm(5)s(2)U. We found accumulations at AAA, CAA, and GAA codons, suggesting that translation is slow when these codons are in the ribosomal A site, but these changes appeared too small to affect protein output.

SECIS-binding protein 2 (SECISBP2) increases the efficiency of this process. Pathogenic mutations in SECISBP2 reduce selenoprotein expression and lead to phenotypes associated with the reduction of deiodinase activities and selenoprotein N expression in humans. Two functions have been ascribed to SECISBP2: binding of SECIS elements in selenoprotein mRNAs and facilitation of co-translational Sec insertion. To separately probe both functions, we established here two mouse models carrying two pathogenic missense mutations in Secisbp2 previously identified in patients. We found that the C696R substitution in the RNA-binding domain abrogates SECIS binding and does not support selenoprotein translation above the level of a complete Secisbp2 null mutation. The R543Q missense substitution located in the selenocysteine insertion domain resulted in residual activity and caused reduced selenoprotein translation, as demonstrated by ribosomal profiling to determine the impact on UGA recoding in individual selenoproteins. We found, however, that the R543Q variant is thermally unstable in vitro and completely degraded in the mouse liver in vivo, while being partially functional in the brain. The moderate impairment of selenoprotein expression in neurons led to astrogliosis and transcriptional induction of genes associated with immune responses. We conclude that differential SECISBP2 protein stability in individual cell types may dictate clinical phenotypes to a much greater extent than molecular interactions involving a mutated amino acid in SECISBP2.",Ribosome profiling of selenoproteins in vivo reveals consequences of pathogenic Secisbp2 missense mutations.,10.1074/jbc.RA119.009369,2019 Sep 27,PMC6768643,The Journal of biological chemistry

However, eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, which suggests that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered.

Energy stress blocks cell growth and proliferation, a critical response for survival under extreme conditions. Excessive oncogenic stress leads to p53 activation and the induction of senescence, an irreversible state of cell-cycle arrest and a critical component in the suppression of tumorigenesis. Nutrient-sensing and mitogenic cues converge on a major signaling node, which regulates the activity of the mTOR kinase. Although transcriptional responses to energy and oncogenic stresses have been examined by many gene-expression experiments, a global exploration of the modulation of mRNA translation in response to these conditions is lacking. RESULTS: We combine RNA sequencing and ribosomal profiling analyses to systematically delineate modes of transcriptional and translational regulation induced in response to conditions of limited energy, oncogenic stress and cellular transformation. We detect a key role for mTOR and p53 in these distinct physiological states, and provide the first genome-wide demonstration that p53 activation results in mTOR inhibition and a consequent global repression of protein translation. We confirm the role of the direct p53 target genes Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 in this response, as part of the broad modulation of gene expression induced by p53 activation. CONCLUSIONS: We delineate a bimodal tumor-suppressive regulatory program activated by p53, in which cell-cycle arrest is imposed mainly at the transcriptional level, whereas cell growth inhibition is enforced by global repression of the translation machinery.",p53 induces transcriptional and translational programs to suppress cell proliferation and growth.,10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-r32,2013 Apr 17,PMC4053767,Genome biology

Depletion of eIF5A enhances upstream translation within 5' UTRs across yeast and human transcriptomes, including on the MYC transcript, where this results in increased production of an N-terminally extended protein.

Little work has been done on circadian regulation of translation, so to address this deficit we conducted ribosome profiling experiments in a human cell model for an autonomous clock. We found that most rhythmic gene expression occurs with little delay between transcription and translation, suggesting that the lag in the accumulation of some clock proteins relative to their mRNAs does not arise from regulated translation. Nevertheless, we found that translation occurs in a circadian fashion for many genes, sometimes imposing an additional level of control on rhythmically expressed mRNAs and, in other cases, conferring rhythms on noncycling mRNAs. Most cyclically transcribed RNAs are translated at one of two major times in a 24-h day, while rhythmic translation of most noncyclic RNAs is phased to a single time of day. Unexpectedly, we found that the clock also regulates the formation of cytoplasmic processing (P) bodies, which control the fate of mRNAs, suggesting circadian coordination of mRNA metabolism and translation.",Ribosome profiling reveals an important role for translational control in circadian gene expression.,10.1101/gr.191296.115,2015 Dec,PMC4665005,Genome research

Although some research indicated that the circRNAs in different subcellular compartments could execute different regulatory functions, a panoramic analysis of the subcellular distribution and the transport mechanism of circRNA is still required. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the subcellular distribution/characteristics and the transport mechanism, through systemically investigating the circRNA profiles among the subcellular fractions of HepG2 cell (nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, ribosome, cytosol and exosome). CircRNAs were widely distributed among the subcellular fractions except in the mitochondria, with differences in the subcellular distribution/characteristics in terms of classification, length, GC content, alternative circularization and parental gene function. Further analysis indicated this might be due to the selective transportation mediated by the transport-related RNA binding proteins (RBPs). The circRNAs may follow the same transportation mechanism of linear RNAs, in which the RBPs specially recognize/transport the RNAs with the corresponding binding motifs. Interestingly, we found that the exosome could selectively package the circRNAs containing the purine-rich 5'-GMWGVWGRAG-3' motif, with the characteristic of 'garbage dumping' and 'intercellular signaling' functions. Besides, although we observed numerous circRNAs enriched in the ribosome, we did not reliably identify any unique-peptides from circRNAs using 3D-LC-MS/MS strategy. This suggests that circRNAs rarely function as translation templates in vivo like lincRNA. Our findings not only indicates the differential distributions/characteristics among the subcellular fractions, but also reveals the possible transportation mechanism.

Gliomas are also complex at the cellular level and involve multiple cell types, including transformed and reactive cells in the brain tumor microenvironment. The distinct functions of the various cell types likely lead to different requirements and regulatory paradigms for protein synthesis. Proneural gliomas can arise from transformation of glial progenitors that are driven to proliferate via mitogenic signaling that affects translation. To investigate translational regulation in this system, we developed a RiboTag glioma mouse model that enables cell-type-specific, genome-wide ribosome profiling of tumor tissue. Infecting glial progenitors with Cre-recombinant retrovirus simultaneously activates expression of tagged ribosomes and delivers a tumor-initiating mutation. Remarkably, we find that although genes specific to transformed cells are highly translated, their translation efficiencies are low compared with normal brain. Ribosome positioning reveals sequence-dependent regulation of ribosomal activity in 5'-leaders upstream of annotated start codons, leading to differential translation in glioma compared with normal brain. Additionally, although transformed cells express a proneural signature, untransformed tumor-associated cells, including reactive astrocytes and microglia, express a mesenchymal signature.

Analysis of a de novo-assembled transcriptome from the plant Aglaia, a natural source of RocA, uncovered the amino acid critical for RocA binding. Moreover, ribosome profiling showed that because of the dominant-negative effect of RocA, high expression of eIF4A and DDX3 strengthens translational repression in cancer cells.

In mammalian mitochondria, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is conducted by mitochondrial RBPs (mt-RBPs) at various stages of mt-RNA metabolism, including polycistronic transcript production, its processing into individual transcripts, mt-RNA modifications, stability, translation and degradation. To date, only a handful of mt-RBPs have been characterized. Here, we describe a putative human mitochondrial protein, C6orf203, that contains an S4-like domain-an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding domain previously identified in proteins involved in translation. Our data show C6orf203 to bind highly structured RNA in vitro and associate with the mitoribosomal large subunit in HEK293T cells. Knockout of C6orf203 leads to a decrease in mitochondrial translation and consequent OXPHOS deficiency, without affecting mitochondrial RNA levels. Although mitoribosome stability is not affected in C6orf203-depleted cells, mitoribosome profiling analysis revealed a global disruption of the association of mt-mRNAs with the mitoribosome, suggesting that C6orf203 may be required for the proper maturation and functioning of the mitoribosome. We therefore propose C6orf203 to be a novel RNA-binding protein involved in mitochondrial translation, expanding the repertoire of factors engaged in this process.",C6orf203 is an RNA-binding protein involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis.,10.1093/nar/gkz684,2019 Sep 26,PMC6755124,Nucleic acids research

The mechanisms underlying disease progression remains unresolved. We have identified a previously unknown direct interaction between the androgen receptor and the translation initiation complex inhibitor 4EBP1 which plays a critical role in protein synthesis rates, mRNA specific translation, and disease progression in vivo. This is mediated through the hyperactivation of the downstream eIF4F translation initiation complex which usurps a network of pro-proliferation mRNAs. Importantly, using both genetic and pharmacologic methods, we demonstrate that dissociation of the eIF4F complex reverses the proliferation program leading to tumor regression.

An extensive body of work has linked these normal and aberrant cellular processes to mRNA transcription; however, the extent to which AR regulates posttranscriptional gene regulation remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that AR uses the translation machinery to shape the cellular proteome. We show that AR is a negative regulator of protein synthesis and identify an unexpected relationship between AR and the process of translation initiation in vivo. This is mediated through direct transcriptional control of the translation inhibitor 4EBP1. We demonstrate that lowering AR abundance increases the assembly of the eIF4F translation initiation complex, which drives enhanced tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, we uncover a network of pro-proliferation mRNAs characterized by a guanine-rich cis-regulatory element that is particularly sensitive to eIF4F hyperactivity. Using both genetic and pharmacologic methods, we demonstrate that dissociation of the eIF4F complex reverses the proliferation program, resulting in decreased tumor growth and improved survival in preclinical models. Our findings reveal a druggable nexus that functionally links the processes of mRNA transcription and translation initiation in an emerging class of lethal AR-deficient prostate cancer.",The androgen receptor regulates a druggable translational regulon in advanced prostate cancer.,10.1126/scitranslmed.aaw4993,2019 Jul 31,PMC6746573,Science translational medicine

Although some of these compounds hold potential for future therapeutic development, it is not known how they impact the physiology of cells or ribosome quality control pathways.

Surprisingly, translation quality control proteins Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. In genetic interaction experiments, ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2, and functions downstream of HBS1L.

Depletion of eIF5A enhances upstream translation within 5' UTRs across yeast and human transcriptomes, including on the MYC transcript, where this results in increased production of an N-terminally extended protein. Furthermore, ribosome profiling experiments established that the function of eIF5A as a suppressor of ribosomal pausing at sites of suboptimal peptide bond formation is conserved in human cells. We present evidence that proximal ribosomal pausing on a transcript triggers enhanced use of upstream suboptimal or non-canonical initiation codons.

It has recently been shown that certain types of cancer cells depend on glycine, glutamine, leucine and serine metabolism to proliferate and survive. In addition, successful therapies using L-asparaginase-induced asparagine deprivation have been developed for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, a tailored detection system for measuring restrictive amino acids in each tumour is currently not available. Here we harness ribosome profiling for sensing restrictive amino acids, and develop diricore, a procedure for differential ribosome measurements of codon reading. We first demonstrate the functionality and constraints of diricore using metabolic inhibitors and nutrient deprivation assays. Notably, treatment with L-asparaginase elicited both specific diricore signals at asparagine codons and high levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS). We then applied diricore to kidney cancer and discover signals indicating restrictive proline. As for asparagine, this observation was linked to high levels of PYCR1, a key enzyme in proline production, suggesting a compensatory mechanism allowing tumour expansion. Indeed, PYCR1 is induced by shortage of proline precursors, and its suppression attenuated kidney cancer cell proliferation when proline was limiting. High PYCR1 is frequently observed in invasive breast carcinoma. In an in vivo model system of this tumour, we also uncover signals indicating restrictive proline. We further show that CRISPR-mediated knockout of PYCR1 impedes tumorigenic growth in this system. Thus, diricore has the potential to reveal unknown amino acid deficiencies, vulnerabilities that can be used to target key metabolic pathways for cancer treatment.",Tumour-specific proline vulnerability uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading.,10.1038/nature16982,2016 Feb 25,,Nature

The unstructured N-terminal tail (NTT) of yeast eIF1A deploys five basic residues to contact tRNAi, mRNA, or 18S rRNA exclusively in the closed state. Interestingly, EIF1AX mutations altering the human eIF1A NTT are associated with uveal melanoma (UM). We found that substituting all five basic residues, and seven UM-associated substitutions, in yeast eIF1A suppresses initiation at near-cognate UUG codons and AUGs in poor context. Ribosome profiling of NTT substitution R13P reveals heightened discrimination against unfavorable AUG context genome-wide. Both R13P and K16D substitutions destabilize the closed complex at UUG codons in reconstituted PICs. Thus, electrostatic interactions involving the eIF1A NTT stabilize the closed conformation and promote utilization of suboptimal start codons.

Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo.

Recent genomic studies have reported recurrent DDX3X mutations in numerous tumors including medulloblastoma (MB), but the physiological impact of these mutations is poorly understood. Here we show that a consistent feature of MB-associated mutations is SG hyper-assembly and concomitant translation impairment. We used CLIP-seq to obtain a comprehensive assessment of DDX3X binding targets and ribosome profiling for high-resolution assessment of global translation. Surprisingly, mutant DDX3X expression caused broad inhibition of translation that impacted DDX3X targeted and non-targeted mRNAs alike. Assessment of translation efficiency with single-cell resolution revealed that SG hyper-assembly correlated precisely with impaired global translation. SG hyper-assembly and translation impairment driven by mutant DDX3X were rescued by a genetic approach that limited SG assembly and by deletion of the N-terminal low complexity domain within DDX3X. Thus, in addition to a primary defect at the level of translation initiation caused by DDX3X mutation, SG assembly itself contributes to global translation inhibition. This work provides mechanistic insights into the consequences of cancer-related DDX3X mutations, suggesting that globally reduced translation may provide a context-dependent survival advantage that must be considered as a possible contributor to tumorigenesis.",Cancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.,10.1038/srep25996,2016 May 16,PMC4867597,Scientific reports

However, the specific role of these enzymes in cancer is still largely unknown. Here we define a pathway that is specific for METTL3 and is implicated in the maintenance of a leukaemic state. We identify METTL3 as an essential gene for growth of acute myeloid leukaemia cells in two distinct genetic screens. Downregulation of METTL3 results in cell cycle arrest, differentiation of leukaemic cells and failure to establish leukaemia in immunodeficient mice. We show that METTL3, independently of METTL14, associates with chromatin and localizes to the transcriptional start sites of active genes. The vast majority of these genes have the CAATT-box binding protein CEBPZ present at the transcriptional start site, and this is required for recruitment of METTL3 to chromatin. Promoter-bound METTL3 induces m(6)A modification within the coding region of the associated mRNA transcript, and enhances its translation by relieving ribosome stalling. We show that genes regulated by METTL3 in this way are necessary for acute myeloid leukaemia. Together, these data define METTL3 as a regulator of a chromatin-based pathway that is necessary for maintenance of the leukaemic state and identify this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target for acute myeloid leukaemia.",Promoter-bound METTL3 maintains myeloid leukaemia by m(6)A-dependent translation control.,10.1038/nature24678,2017 Dec 7,PMC6217924,Nature

In the present study, we investigated mechanism(s) by which suppression of RPL12 rescues F508del protein synthesis and activity.

Rpl12 knockdown also partially restored maturation of specific CFTR variants in addition to F508del, and WT Cftr biogenesis was enhanced in the pancreas, colon, and ileum of Rpl12 haplosufficient mice.

Thanks to its unique ability to provide positional information about ribosomes flowing along transcripts, this method can be used to shed light on mechanistic aspects of translation. However, current Ribo-seq approaches lack the ability to distinguish between fragments protected by either ribosomes in active translation or inactive ribosomes. To overcome this possible limitation, we developed RiboLace, a method based on an original puromycin-containing molecule capable of isolating active ribosomes by means of an antibody-free and tag-free pull-down approach. RiboLace is fast, works reliably with low amounts of input material, and can be easily and rapidly applied both in vitro and in vivo, thereby generating a global snapshot of active ribosome footprints at single nucleotide resolution.",Active Ribosome Profiling with RiboLace.,10.1016/j.celrep.2018.09.084,2018 Oct 23,,Cell reports

BCL11A represses the genes encoding HbF and regulates human hemoglobin switching through variation in its expression during development(2-7).

Here we show that BCL11A is regulated at the level of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation during human hematopoietic development. Despite decreased BCL11A protein synthesis earlier in development, BCL11A mRNA continues to be associated with ribosomes. Through unbiased genomic and proteomic analyses, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding protein LIN28B, which is developmentally expressed in a pattern reciprocal to that of BCL11A, directly interacts with ribosomes and BCL11A mRNA. Furthermore, we show that BCL11A mRNA translation is suppressed by LIN28B through direct interactions, independently of its role in regulating let-7 microRNAs, and that BCL11A is the major target of LIN28B-mediated HbF induction.

RocA targets eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), an ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase; its messenger RNA selectivity is proposed to reflect highly structured 5' untranslated regions that depend strongly on eIF4A-mediated unwinding. However, rocaglate treatment may not phenocopy the loss of eIF4A activity, as these drugs actually increase the affinity between eIF4A and RNA. Here we show that secondary structure in 5' untranslated regions is only a minor determinant for RocA selectivity and that RocA does not repress translation by reducing eIF4A availability. Rather, in vitro and in cells, RocA specifically clamps eIF4A onto polypurine sequences in an ATP-independent manner. This artificially clamped eIF4A blocks 43S scanning, leading to premature, upstream translation initiation and reducing protein expression from transcripts bearing the RocA-eIF4A target sequence.

Existing methods suffer from high false-positive rates and are unable to effectively differentiate direct miRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes. Here, we present an experimental and computational framework to deconvolute post-transcriptional and transcriptional changes using a combination of RNA-seq and PRO-seq. This novel approach allows us to systematically profile the regulatory impact of a miRNA. We refer to this approach as CARP: Combined Analysis of RNA-seq and PRO-seq. We apply CARP to multiple miRNAs and show that it robustly distinguishes direct targets from downstream changes, while greatly reducing false positives. We validate our approach using Argonaute eCLIP-seq and ribosome profiling, demonstrating that CARP defines a comprehensive repertoire of targets. Using this approach, we identify miRNA-specific activity of target sites within the open reading frame. Additionally, we show that CARP facilitates the dissection of complex changes in gene regulatory networks triggered by miRNAs and identification of transcription factors that mediate downstream regulatory changes. Given the robustness of the approach, CARP would be particularly suitable for dissecting miRNA regulatory networks in vivo.",Robust partitioning of microRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes.,10.1093/nar/gkaa687,2020 Sep 25,PMC7515711,Nucleic acids research

Here we report ac(4)C-seq, a chemical genomic method for the transcriptome-wide quantitative mapping of ac(4)C at single-nucleotide resolution. In human and yeast mRNAs, ac(4)C sites are not detected but can be induced-at a conserved sequence motif-via the ectopic overexpression of eukaryotic acetyltransferase complexes. By contrast, cross-evolutionary profiling revealed unprecedented levels of ac(4)C across hundreds of residues in rRNA, tRNA, non-coding RNA and mRNA from hyperthermophilic archaea. Ac(4)C is markedly induced in response to increases in temperature, and acetyltransferase-deficient archaeal strains exhibit temperature-dependent growth defects. Visualization of wild-type and acetyltransferase-deficient archaeal ribosomes by cryo-electron microscopy provided structural insights into the temperature-dependent distribution of ac(4)C and its potential thermoadaptive role. Our studies quantitatively define the ac(4)C landscape, providing a technical and conceptual foundation for elucidating the role of this modification in biology and disease(4-6).",Dynamic RNA acetylation revealed by quantitative cross-evolutionary mapping.,10.1038/s41586-020-2418-2,2020 Jul,PMC8130014,Nature

Induction of the ribosome rescue factors PELO and HBS1L is required to support protein synthesis when ABCE1 levels fall and for hemoglobin production during blood cell development.

Their cross-correlation suggests generation of mitochondrial RPFs during ribosome progression. In contrast, RPFs from patient-derived mitochondria mutated in tRNA-Tryptophan are centered on tryptophan codons and reduced downstream, indicating ribosome stalling. Intriguingly, long RPFs are enriched in mutated mitochondria, suggesting they characterize stalled ribosomes.

Methionine starvation caused the most drastic decrease in translation as assessed by polysome formation, ribosome profiling, and a measure of protein synthesis (puromycin-labeled polypeptides) but had no significant effect on eIF2 phosphorylation, 4EBP1 hyperphosphorylation or 4EBP1 binding to eIF4E. Leucine starvation suppressed polysome formation and was the only tested condition that caused a significant decrease in 4EBP1 phosphorylation or increase in 4EBP1 binding to eIF4E, but effects of leucine starvation were not replicated by overexpressing nonphosphorylatable 4EBP1. This suggests the binding of 4EBP1 to eIF4E may not by itself explain the suppression of mRNA translation under conditions of leucine starvation. Ribosome profiling suggested that leucine deprivation may primarily inhibit ribosome loading, whereas methionine deprivation may primarily impair start site recognition.

A common source of aberrant mRNAs is premature polyadenylation, which can result in non-functional protein products. Translating ribosomes that encounter poly(A) sequences are terminally stalled, followed by ribosome recycling and decay of the truncated nascent polypeptide via ribosome-associated quality control. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that the conserved RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) promotes ribosome stalling at poly(A) sequences during ribosome-associated quality control. We show that MKRN1 directly binds to the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1) and associates with polysomes. MKRN1 is positioned upstream of poly(A) tails in mRNAs in a PABPC1-dependent manner. Ubiquitin remnant profiling and in vitro ubiquitylation assays uncover PABPC1 and ribosomal protein RPS10 as direct ubiquitylation substrates of MKRN1.

Although blood levels of PFOS have begun to decline, health concerns remain because of the long half-life of PFOS in humans. Like other PFAAs, such as, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), PFOS is an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) and exhibits hepatocarcinogenic potential in rodents. PFOS is also a developmental toxicant in rodents where, unlike PFOA, its mode of action is independent of PPARalpha.

Animals were euthanized, livers weighed, and liver samples collected for histology and preparation of total RNA. Gene profiling was conducted using Affymetrix 430_2 microarrays. In WT mice, PFOS induced changes that were characteristic of PPARalpha transactivation including regulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, peroxisome biogenesis, proteasome activation, and inflammation. PPARalpha-independent changes were indicated in both WT and Null mice by altered expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, and xenobiotic metabolism. Such results are similar to studies done with PFOA and are consistent with modest activation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and possibly PPARgamma and/or PPARbeta/delta. Unique treatment-related effects were also found in Null mice including altered expression of genes associated with ribosome biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and cholesterol biosynthesis. Of interest was up-regulation of Cyp7a1, a gene which is under the control of various transcription regulators.

These cellular activities are important for avoiding the initiation of carcinogenesis in skin. Central to these processes is the repression of initiation of mRNA translation through GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF2alpha (eIF2alpha-P). Concurrent with reduced global protein synthesis, eIF2alpha-P and the accompanying integrated stress response (ISR) selectively enhance translation of mRNAs involved in stress adaptation. In this study, we elucidated a mechanism for eIF2alpha-P cytoprotection in response to UVB in human keratinocytes. Loss of eIF2alpha-P induced by UVB diminished G1 arrest, DNA repair, and cellular senescence coincident with enhanced cell death in human keratinocytes. Genome-wide analysis of translation revealed that the mechanism for these critical adaptive responses by eIF2alpha-P involved induced expression of CDKN1A encoding the p21 (CIP1/WAF1) protein. We further show that human CDKN1A mRNA splice variant 4 is preferentially translated following stress-induced eIF2alpha-P by a mechanism mediated in part by upstream ORFs situated in the 5'-leader of CDKN1A mRNA. We conclude that eIF2alpha-P is cytoprotective in response to UVB by a mechanism featuring translation of a specific splice variant of CDKN1A that facilitates G1 arrest and subsequent DNA repair.",Translational control of a human CDKN1A mRNA splice variant regulates the fate of UVB-irradiated human keratinocytes.,10.1091/mbc.E17-06-0362,2018 Jan 1,PMC5746064,Molecular biology of the cell

Despite being implicated in several facets of RNA metabolism, the nature and scope of DDX3's interactions with RNA remain unclear. Here, we show DDX3 collaborates extensively with the translation initiation machinery through direct binding to 5'UTRs of nearly all coding RNAs, specific sites on the 18S rRNA, and multiple components of the translation initiation complex. Impairment of translation initiation is also evident in primary medulloblastomas harboring mutations in DDX3X, further highlighting DDX3's role in this process. Arsenite-induced stress shifts DDX3 binding from the 5'UTR into the coding region of mRNAs concomitant with a general reduction of translation, and both the shift of DDX3 on mRNA and decreased translation are blunted by expression of a catalytically-impaired, medulloblastoma-associated DDX3R534H variant. Furthermore, despite the global repression of translation induced by arsenite, translation is preserved on select genes involved in chromatin organization in DDX3R534H-expressing cells. Thus, DDX3 interacts extensively with RNA and ribosomal machinery to help remodel the translation landscape in response to stress, while cancer-related DDX3 variants adapt this response to selectively preserve translation.",Medulloblastoma-associated DDX3 variant selectively alters the translational response to stress.,10.18632/oncotarget.8612,2016 May 10,PMC5053718,Oncotarget

Here we use an integrated systems-level examination of transcription, translation, and proteolysis to understand these events central to cancer treatment. As a model we study myeloma cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a first-line therapy. Despite robust transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative proteomics detects production of only a few critical anti-apoptotic proteins against a background of general translation inhibition. Simultaneous ribosome profiling further reveals potential translational regulation of stress response genes. Once the apoptotic machinery is engaged, degradation by caspases is largely independent of upstream bortezomib effects. Moreover, previously uncharacterized non-caspase proteolytic events also participate in cellular deconstruction. Our systems-level data also support co-targeting the anti-apoptotic regulator HSF1 to promote cell death by bortezomib. This integrated approach offers unique, in-depth insight into apoptotic dynamics that may prove important to preclinical evaluation of any anti-cancer compound.

Recent genomic studies have reported recurrent DDX3X mutations in numerous tumors including medulloblastoma (MB), but the physiological impact of these mutations is poorly understood. Here we show that a consistent feature of MB-associated mutations is SG hyper-assembly and concomitant translation impairment. We used CLIP-seq to obtain a comprehensive assessment of DDX3X binding targets and ribosome profiling for high-resolution assessment of global translation. Surprisingly, mutant DDX3X expression caused broad inhibition of translation that impacted DDX3X targeted and non-targeted mRNAs alike. Assessment of translation efficiency with single-cell resolution revealed that SG hyper-assembly correlated precisely with impaired global translation. SG hyper-assembly and translation impairment driven by mutant DDX3X were rescued by a genetic approach that limited SG assembly and by deletion of the N-terminal low complexity domain within DDX3X. Thus, in addition to a primary defect at the level of translation initiation caused by DDX3X mutation, SG assembly itself contributes to global translation inhibition. This work provides mechanistic insights into the consequences of cancer-related DDX3X mutations, suggesting that globally reduced translation may provide a context-dependent survival advantage that must be considered as a possible contributor to tumorigenesis.",Cancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.,10.1038/srep25996,2016 May 16,PMC4867597,Scientific reports

Here, to identify secreted signals underlying human HSC development, we combined spatial transcriptomics analysis of dorsoventral polarized signaling in the aorta with gene expression profiling of sorted cell populations and single cells. Our analysis revealed a subset of aortic endothelial cells with a downregulated arterial signature and a predicted lineage relationship with the emerging HSC/progenitor population. Analysis of the ventrally polarized molecular landscape identified endothelin 1 as an important secreted regulator of human HSC development.

Here we show that global changes in transcription and RNA processing and their impact on translation can be analysed in a single experimental setting by applying 4sU-tagging of newly transcribed RNA and ribosome profiling to lytic HSV-1 infection. Unexpectedly, we find that HSV-1 triggers the disruption of transcription termination of cellular, but not viral, genes. This results in extensive transcription for tens of thousands of nucleotides beyond poly(A) sites and into downstream genes, leading to novel intergenic splicing between exons of neighbouring cellular genes. As a consequence, hundreds of cellular genes seem to be transcriptionally induced but are not translated.

Transplacental arsenic exposure promotes atherogenesis in apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice. Because the liver plays a central role in atherosclerosis, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, we hypothesized that accelerated atherosclerosis may be linked to altered hepatic development. This hypothesis was tested in ApoE(-/-) mice exposed to 49 ppm arsenic in utero from gestational day (GD) 8 to term. GD18 hepatic arsenic was 1.2 microg/g in dams and 350 ng/g in fetuses. The hepatic transcriptome was evaluated by microarray analysis to assess mRNA and microRNA abundance in control and exposed pups at postnatal day (PND) 1 and PND70. Arsenic exposure altered postnatal developmental trajectory of mRNA and microRNA profiles. We identified an arsenic exposure related 51-gene signature at PND1 and PND70 with several hubs of interaction (Hspa8, IgM and Hnf4a). Gene ontology (GO) annotation analyses indicated that pathways for gluconeogenesis and glycolysis were suppressed in exposed pups at PND1, and pathways for protein export, ribosome, antigen processing and presentation, and complement and coagulation cascades were induced by PND70. Promoter analysis of differentially-expressed transcripts identified enriched transcription factor binding sites and clustering to common regulatory sites. SREBP1 binding sites were identified in about 16% of PND70 differentially-expressed genes. Western blot analysis confirmed changes in the liver at PND70 that included increases of heat shock protein 70 (Hspa8) and active SREBP1. Plasma AST and ALT levels were increased at PND70. These results suggest that transplacental arsenic exposure alters developmental programming in fetal liver, leading to an enduring stress and proinflammatory response postnatally that may contribute to early onset of atherosclerosis. Genes containing SREBP1 binding sites also suggest pathways for diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis, both diseases that contribute to increased cardiovascular disease in humans.",Prenatal arsenic exposure alters gene expression in the adult liver to a proinflammatory state contributing to accelerated atherosclerosis.,10.1371/journal.pone.0038713,2012,PMC3376138,PloS one

Until now, research mainly focused on differences in core ribosomal proteins and associated factors. The effect of posttranslational modifications has not been studied systematically. Analyzing ribosome heterogeneity is challenging because individual proteins can be part of different subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S, and polysomes). Here we develop polysome proteome profiling to obtain unbiased proteomic maps across ribosomal subcomplexes. Our method combines extensive fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation with quantitative mass spectrometry. The high resolution of the profiles allows us to assign proteins to specific subcomplexes. Phosphoproteomics on the fractions reveals that phosphorylation of serine 38 in RPL12/uL11, a known mitotic CDK1 substrate, is strongly depleted in polysomes. Follow-up experiments confirm that RPL12/uL11 phosphorylation regulates the translation of specific subsets of mRNAs during mitosis.

We identified over 3,000 cellular RNA targets of YTHDF2, most of which are mRNAs, but which also include non-coding RNAs, with a conserved core motif of G(m(6)A)C. We further establish the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism, showing that binding of YTHDF2 results in the localization of bound mRNA from the translatable pool to mRNA decay sites, such as processing bodies. The carboxy-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m(6)A-containing mRNA, whereas the amino-terminal domain is responsible for the localization of the YTHDF2-mRNA complex to cellular RNA decay sites. Our results indicate that the dynamic m(6)A modification is recognized by selectively binding proteins to affect the translation status and lifetime of mRNA.",N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability.,10.1038/nature12730,2014 Jan 2,PMC3877715,Nature

This revealed multiple insights. First, the three parameters displayed systematic statistical differences. Sequentially more genes exhibited extreme (low or high) expression values from TR to RA, and then to TA; that is, cellular coordination of multiple transcriptome regulatory mechanisms leads to sequentially enhanced gene expression selectivity as the genetic information flow from the genome to the proteome. Second, contribution of the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism to the cellular coordination process was assessed. The data enabled an estimation of mRNA stability, revealing a moderate but significant positive correlation between mRNA stability and translation activity. Third, the proportion of mRNA occupied by un-translated regions (UTR) exhibited a negative relationship with the level of this correlation, and was thus a major determinant of the mode of regulation of the mRNA. High-UTR-proportion mRNAs tend to defy the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism, staying out of the polysome but remaining stable; mRNAs with little UTRs largely followed this regulation.

There is increasing interest in targeting eIF4A1 therapeutically in cancer, thus understanding how this protein leads to the selective re-programming of the translational landscape is critical. While it is known that eIF4A1-dependent mRNAs frequently have long GC-rich 5'UTRs, the details of how 5'UTR structure is resculptured by eIF4A1 to enhance the translation of specific mRNAs are unknown. RESULTS: Using Structure-seq2 and polysome profiling, we assess global mRNA structure and translational efficiency in MCF7 cells, with and without eIF4A inhibition with hippuristanol. We find that eIF4A inhibition does not lead to global increases in 5'UTR structure, but rather it leads to 5'UTR remodeling, with localized gains and losses of structure. The degree of these localized structural changes is associated with 5'UTR length, meaning that eIF4A-dependent mRNAs have greater localized gains of structure due to their increased 5'UTR length. However, it is not solely increased localized structure that causes eIF4A-dependency but the position of the structured regions, as these structured elements are located predominantly at the 3' end of the 5'UTR. CONCLUSIONS: By measuring changes in RNA structure following eIF4A inhibition, we show that eIF4A remodels local 5'UTR structures. The location of these structural elements ultimately determines the dependency on eIF4A, with increased structure just upstream of the CDS being the major limiting factor in translation, which is overcome by eIF4A activity.",mRNA structural elements immediately upstream of the start codon dictate dependence upon eIF4A helicase activity.,10.1186/s13059-019-1901-2,2019 Dec 30,PMC6936103,Genome biology

Here we systematically investigate the extent and impact of alternate translation initiation in cells infected with influenza virus. We perform evolutionary analyses that suggest selection against non-canonical initiation at CUG codons in influenza virus lineages that have adapted to mammalian hosts. We then use ribosome profiling with the initiation inhibitor lactimidomycin to experimentally delineate translation initiation sites in a human lung epithelial cell line infected with influenza virus. We identify several candidate sites of alternate initiation in influenza mRNAs, all of which occur at AUG codons that are downstream of canonical initiation codons. One of these candidate downstream start sites truncates 14 amino acids from the N-terminus of the N1 neuraminidase protein, resulting in loss of its cytoplasmic tail and a portion of the transmembrane domain. This truncated neuraminidase protein is expressed on the cell surface during influenza virus infection, is enzymatically active, and is conserved in most N1 viral lineages. We do not detect globally higher levels of alternate translation initiation on host transcripts upon influenza infection or during the anti-viral response, but the subset of host transcripts induced by the anti-viral response is enriched for alternate initiation sites.

Here, using ribosome profiling, we find both a global translational repression and identified ~200 mRNAs that undergo specific translational regulation at mitotic entry. In contrast, few changes in mRNA abundance are observed, indicating that regulation of translation is the primary mechanism of modulating protein expression during mitosis. Interestingly, 91% of the mRNAs that undergo gene-specific regulation in mitosis are translationally repressed, rather than activated. One of the most pronounced translationally-repressed genes is Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex (APC) which is degraded during mitosis. We show that full APC activation requires translational repression of Emi1 in addition to its degradation. These results identify gene-specific translational repression as a means of controlling the mitotic proteome, which may complement post-translational mechanisms for inactivating protein function.",Regulation of mRNA translation during mitosis.,10.7554/eLife.07957,2015 Aug 25,PMC4548207,eLife

We use a DNA linker carrying four randomized positions at its 5' end and a reverse-transcription (RT) primer with three randomized positions to reduce artifacts during library preparation. The use of seven randomized nucleotides allows to efficiently detect library-generation artifacts. We find that the effect of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) artifacts is relatively small for global analyses when sufficient input material is used. However, when input material is limiting, our strategy improves the sensitivity of gene-specific analyses. Furthermore, randomized nucleotides alleviate the skewed frequency of specific sequences at the 3' end of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) likely resulting from ligase specificity. Finally, strategies that rely on dual ligation show a high degree of gene-coverage variation. Taken together, our approach helps to remedy two of the main problems associated with ribosome-profiling data. This will facilitate the analysis of translational dynamics and increase our understanding of the influence of RNA modifications on translation.",Dual randomization of oligonucleotides to reduce the bias in ribosome-profiling libraries.,10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.07.011,2016 Sep 1,PMC5024760,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)"

Twenty-two species of mitochondrial (mt-)tRNAs encoded in mtDNA translate essential subunits of the respiratory chain complexes. mt-tRNAs contain post-transcriptional modifications introduced by nuclear-encoded tRNA-modifying enzymes. They are required for deciphering genetic code accurately, as well as stabilizing tRNA. Loss of tRNA modifications frequently results in severe pathological consequences. Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of post-transcriptional modifications of all human mt-tRNAs, including 14 previously-uncharacterized species. In total, we find 18 kinds of RNA modifications at 137 positions (8.7% in 1575 nucleobases) in 22 species of human mt-tRNAs. An up-to-date list of 34 genes responsible for mt-tRNA modifications are provided. We identify two genes required for queuosine (Q) formation in mt-tRNAs. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the decoding system and could help to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of human mitochondrial diseases caused by aberrant tRNA modifications.",Complete chemical structures of human mitochondrial tRNAs.,10.1038/s41467-020-18068-6,2020 Aug 28,PMC7455718,Nature communications

For ribosome pauses, fundamental issues remain to be addressed, including where ribosomes pause on mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid sequence causes this pause, and the physiological significance of this attenuation of protein synthesis. Here, we survey the positions of ribosome collisions caused by ribosome pauses in humans and zebrafish using modified ribosome profiling. Collided ribosomes, i.e., disomes, emerge at various sites: Pro-Pro/Gly/Asp motifs; Arg-X-Lys motifs; stop codons; and 3' untranslated regions. The electrostatic interaction between the charged nascent chain and the ribosome exit tunnel determines the eIF5A-mediated disome rescue at the Pro-Pro sites. In particular, XBP1u, a precursor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-responsive transcription factor, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes and thus acts as a degradation substrate by ribosome-associated quality control.

However, it is also the most prevalent fungus of the normal human microbiome, where it shares its habitat with hundreds of trillions of other microbial cells. Despite weak organic acids (WOAs) being among the most abundant metabolites produced by bacterial microbiota, little is known about their effect on C. albicans. Here we used a sequencing-based profiling strategy to systematically investigate the transcriptional stress response of C. albicans to lactic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acid at several time points after treatment. Our data reveal a complex transcriptional response, with individual WOAs triggering unique gene expression profiles and with important differences between acute and chronic exposure. Despite these dissimilarities, we found significant overlaps between the gene expression changes induced by each WOA, which led us to uncover a core transcriptional response that was largely unrelated to other previously published C. albicans transcriptional stress responses. Genes commonly up-regulated by WOAs were enriched in several iron transporters, which was associated with an overall decrease in intracellular iron concentrations. Moreover, chronic exposure to any WOA lead to down-regulation of RNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis genes, which resulted in significant reduction of total RNA levels and of ribosomal RNA in particular. In conclusion, this study suggests that gastrointestinal microbiota might directly influence C. albicans physiology via production of WOAs, with possible implications of how this fungus interacts with its host in both health and disease.",The transcriptional stress response of Candida albicans to weak organic acids.,10.1534/g3.114.015941,2015 Jan 29,PMC4390566,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)"

ZNF658 was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry of a band excised after electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a ZTRE probe. The protein contains a KRAB domain and 21 zinc fingers. It has similarity with ZAP1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which regulates the response to zinc restriction, including a conserved DNA binding region we show to be functional also in ZNF658. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ZNF658 abrogated the zinc-induced, ZTRE-dependent reduction in SLC30A5 (ZnT5 gene), SLC30A10 (ZnT10 gene), and CBWD transcripts in human Caco-2 cells and the ability of zinc to repress reporter gene expression from corresponding promoter-reporter constructs. Microarray analysis of the effect of reducing ZNF658 expression by siRNA uncovered a large decrease in rRNA. We find that ZTREs are clustered within the 45S rRNA precursor. We also saw effects on expression of multiple ribosomal proteins. ZNF658 thus links zinc homeostasis with ribosome biogenesis, the most active transcriptional, and hence zinc-demanding, process in the cell.

Because these translatomes were obtained under conditions when ISG expression is not induced, we examined the mTOR-sensitive translatome in human WISH cells stimulated with IFN beta. The mTOR inhibitor Torin1 resulted in a repression of global protein synthesis, including that of ISG products, and translation of all but 3 ISG mRNAs (TLR3, NT5C3A, and RNF19B) was not selectively more sensitive to mTOR inhibition. Detailed studies of NT5C3A revealed an IFN-induced change in transcription start site resulting in a switch from a non-TOP to a TOP-like transcript variant and mTOR sensitive translation. Thus, we show that, in the cell model used, translation of the vast majority of ISG mRNAs is not selectively sensitive to mTOR activity and describe an uncharacterized mechanism wherein the 5'-UTR of an mRNA is altered in response to a cytokine, resulting in a shift from mTOR-insensitive to mTOR-sensitive translation.",Assessment of mTOR-Dependent Translational Regulation of Interferon Stimulated Genes.,10.1371/journal.pone.0133482,2015,PMC4514843,PloS one

Patients have an increased risk of solid tumors. Mutations have been found in several ribosomal protein (RP) genes, i.e RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, RPL35A. Studies in haematopoietic progenitors from patients show that haplo-insufficiency of an RP impairs rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. DBA lymphocytes show reduced protein synthesis and fibroblasts display abnormal rRNA processing and impaired proliferation. RESULTS: To evaluate the involvement of non-haematopoietic tissues in DBA, we have analysed global gene expression in fibroblasts from DBA patients compared to healthy controls. Microarray expression profiling using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Arrays revealed that 421 genes are differentially expressed in DBA patient fibroblasts. These genes include a large cluster of ribosomal proteins and factors involved in protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism, as well as genes associated to cell death, cancer and tissue development. CONCLUSION: This analysis reports for the first time an abnormal gene expression profile in a non-haematopoietic cell type in DBA. These data support the hypothesis that DBA may be due to a defect in general or specific protein synthesis.","Fibroblasts from patients with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia show abnormal expression of genes involved in protein synthesis, amino acid metabolism and cancer.",10.1186/1471-2164-10-442,2009 Sep 18,PMC2760583,BMC genomics

Here, we use genome-wide high-throughput methods to identify potential micropeptides in smORF-containing lncRNAs involved in the immune response. Using influenza as a viral infection model, we performed RNA-seq and ribosome profiling to track expression and translation of putative lncRNAs that may encode for peptides and identify tens of potential candidates. Interestingly, many of these peptides are highly conserved at the protein level, strongly suggesting biological relevance and activity. By perusing publicly available data sets, four potential peptides of interest seem common to stress induction and/or are highly conserved; potential peptides from the MMP24-AS1, ZFAS1, RP11-622K12.1, and MIR22HG genes. Interestingly, using an antibody against the potential peptide encoded by MIR22HG RNA, we show that the peptide is stably expressed in the absence of infection, and upregulated in response to infection, corroborating the prediction of the ribosome profiling results.

The sudden interest in a 40 year old discovery was due in part to the finding of FTO's (Fat Mass Obesity) N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) deaminase activity, thus suggesting a link between obesity-associated diseases and the presence of m6A in mRNA. Another catalyst of the sudden rise in mRNA methylation research was the release of mRNA methylomes for human, mouse and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the molecular function, or functions of this mRNA 'epimark' remain to be discovered. There is supportive evidence that m6A could be a mark for mRNA degradation due to its binding to YTH domain proteins, and consequently being chaperoned to P bodies. Nonetheless, only a subpopulation of the methylome was found binding to YTHDF2 in HeLa cells.The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has only one YTH domain protein (Pho92, Mrb1), which targets PHO4 transcripts for degradation under phosphate starvation. However, mRNA methylation is only found under meiosis inducing conditions, and PHO4 transcripts are apparently non-methylated. In this paper we set out to investigate if m6A could function alternatively to being a degradation mark in S. cerevisiae; we also sought to test whether it can be induced under non-standard sporulation conditions. We find a positive association between the presence of m6A and message translatability. We also find m6A induction following prolonged rapamycin treatment.","Yeast m6A Methylated mRNAs Are Enriched on Translating Ribosomes during Meiosis, and under Rapamycin Treatment.",10.1371/journal.pone.0132090,2015,PMC4505848,PloS one

Platforms using the whole adult organism to evaluate the genome-wide response to toxicants are especially attractive. Recent work demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in vertebrates using the experimentally robust zebrafish model. In the present study, we evaluated gene expression changes in whole adult male zebrafish following an acute 24 hr high dose exposure to three metals with known human health risks. Male adult zebrafish were exposed to nickel chloride, cobalt chloride or sodium dichromate concentrations corresponding to their respective 96 hr LC20, LC40 and LC60. Histopathology was performed on a subset of metal-exposed zebrafish to phenotypically anchor transcriptional changes associated with each metal. RESULTS: Comparative analysis identified subsets of differentially expressed transcripts both overlapping and unique to each metal. Application of gene ontology (GO) and transcription factor (TF) enrichment algorithms revealed a number of key biological processes perturbed by metal poisonings and the master transcriptional regulators mediating gene expression changes. Metal poisoning differentially activated biological processes associated with ribosome biogenesis, proteosomal degradation, and p53 signaling cascades, while repressing oxygen-generating pathways associated with amino acid and lipid metabolism. Despite appreciable effects on gene regulation, nickel poisoning did not induce any morphological alterations in male zebrafish organs and tissues. Histopathological effects of cobalt remained confined to the olfactory system, while chromium targeted the gills, pharynx, and intestinal mucosa. A number of enriched transcription factors mediated the observed gene response to metal poisoning, including known targets such as p53, HIF1alpha, and the myc oncogene, and novel regulatory factors such as XBP1, GATA6 and HNF3beta.

Here, we employed ribosome profiling, mRNA sequencing and small RNA sequencing to profile transcriptome-wide changes in mRNA translation after whole cell depolarization of differentiated neuroblast cultures, and investigate the contribution of sequence-specific regulatory mechanisms. Immediately after depolarization, a functional partition between transcriptional and translational responses was uncovered, in which many mRNAs were subjected to significant changes in abundance or ribosomal occupancy, but not both. After an extended (2 h) post-stimulus rest phase, however, these changes became synchronized, suggesting that there are different layers of post-transcriptional regulation which are temporally separated but become coordinated over time. Globally, changes in mRNA abundance and translation were found to be associated with a number of intrinsic mRNA features, including mRNA length, GC% and secondary structures; however, the effect of these factors differed between both post-depolarization time-points. Furthermore, small RNA sequencing revealed that miRNAs and tRNA-derived small RNA fragments were subjected to peak changes in expression immediately after stimulation, during which these molecules were predominantly associated with fluctuations in mRNA abundance, consistent with known regulatory mechanisms. These data suggest that excitation-associated neuronal translation is subjected to extensive temporal coordination, with substantial contributions from a number of sequence-dependent regulatory mechanisms.","Transcriptome-Wide Analysis of Interplay between mRNA Stability, Translation and Small RNAs in Response to Neuronal Membrane Depolarization.",10.3390/ijms21197086,2020 Sep 25,PMC7582590,International journal of molecular sciences

Combined analysis of RNA expression and ribosome occupancy improves the identification of individual protein level differences. Finally, we identify genetic differences that specifically modulate ribosome occupancy--many of these differences lie close to start codons and upstream ORFs.

Being the most prevalent internal modification in mRNA, the N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) mRNA modification is as an important post-transcriptional mechanism of gene regulation(2-4) and has crucial roles in various normal and pathological processes(5-12). However, it is unclear how m(6)A is specifically and dynamically deposited in the transcriptome. Here we report that histone H3 trimethylation at Lys36 (H3K36me3), a marker for transcription elongation, guides m(6)A deposition globally. We show that m(6)A modifications are enriched in the vicinity of H3K36me3 peaks, and are reduced globally when cellular H3K36me3 is depleted. Mechanistically, H3K36me3 is recognized and bound directly by METTL14, a crucial component of the m(6)A methyltransferase complex (MTC), which in turn facilitates the binding of the m(6)A MTC to adjacent RNA polymerase II, thereby delivering the m(6)A MTC to actively transcribed nascent RNAs to deposit m(6)A co-transcriptionally. In mouse embryonic stem cells, phenocopying METTL14 knockdown, H3K36me3 depletion also markedly reduces m(6)A abundance transcriptome-wide and in pluripotency transcripts, resulting in increased cell stemness. Collectively, our studies reveal the important roles of H3K36me3 and METTL14 in determining specific and dynamic deposition of m(6)A in mRNA, and uncover another layer of gene expression regulation that involves crosstalk between histone modification and RNA methylation.",Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 guides m(6)A RNA modification co-transcriptionally.,10.1038/s41586-019-1016-7,2019 Mar,PMC6438714,Nature

Since the effect of cycloheximide on ribosome translocation is instantaneous, it is assumed that the ribosomal association obtained truly represents the intracellular association.   Huh7.5.1 cells cultured in 10 cm dish are treated with cycloheximide (C-7698, Sigma) to a final concentration of 100 \uf06dg/ml for 10 sec.   The cells are washed twice in 5 ml ice-cold PBS.

Cell clumps are dispersed by piptting several times and incubated for 10 min on ice. To achieve efficient cell lysis, we triturate the cells ten times through a 26 gauge needle. Finally, we clarify the lysate by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 � g, 4�C and recover the soluble supernatant.  The sample is carefully loaded on the sucrose gradient. Polysomal complexes are resolved by ultracentrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 150 min at 4 �C in a SW41 rotor. These settings are optimal for separation between polysomal and non-polysomal complexes.  Polysomes-associated mRNAs isolation  Following centrifugation, the gradient is divided into two fractions that are collected based on the ribosomal complexes they contain.

Viruses depend on cellular molecules-which are attractive alternative targets-for their life cycle, provided that they are dispensable for normal cell functions. Using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, we identify the ribosomal protein RACK1 as a cellular factor required for infection by internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-containing viruses. We further show that RACK1 is an essential determinant for hepatitis C virus translation and infection, indicating that its function is conserved for distantly related human and fly viruses. Inhibition of RACK1 does not affect Drosophila or human cell viability and proliferation, and RACK1-silenced adult flies are viable, indicating that this protein is not essential for general translation.

In order to capture subtle but biologically significant differences in translation in these disorders, a robust technique is required. One powerful tool to study translational control is ribosome profiling, which is based on deep sequencing of mRNA fragments protected from ribonuclease (RNase) digestion by ribosomes. However, this approach has been mainly applied to rapidly dividing cells where translation is active and large amounts of starting material are readily available. The application of ribosome profiling to low-input brain tissue where translation is modest and gene expression changes between genotypes are expected to be small has not been carefully evaluated. Using hippocampal tissue from wide type and fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) knockout mice, we show that variable RNase digestion can lead to significant sample batch effects. We also establish GC content and ribosome footprint length as quality control metrics for RNase digestion. We performed RNase titration experiments for low-input samples to identify optimal conditions for this critical step that is often improperly conducted. Our data reveal that optimal RNase digestion is essential to ensure high quality and reproducibility of ribosome profiling for low-input brain tissue.",Optimization of ribosome profiling using low-input brain tissue from fragile X syndrome model mice.,10.1093/nar/gky1292,2019 Mar 18,PMC6411937,Nucleic acids research

Here we describe the collection of RNAs regulated by AUF1 (AU-binding factor 1), an RBP linked to cancer, inflammation and aging. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) analysis reveals that AUF1 primarily recognizes U-/GU-rich sequences in mRNAs and noncoding RNAs and influences target transcript fate in three main directions. First, AUF1 lowers the steady-state levels of numerous target RNAs, including long noncoding RNA NEAT1, in turn affecting the organization of nuclear paraspeckles. Second, AUF1 does not change the abundance of many target RNAs, but ribosome profiling reveals that AUF1 promotes the translation of numerous mRNAs in this group.

This can be achieved by the phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of a key translation initiation factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). However, the persistent translation of certain mRNAs is required for deployment of an adequate stress response. We carried out ribosome profiling of cultured human cells under conditions of severe stress induced with sodium arsenite. Although this led to a 5.4-fold general translational repression, the protein coding open reading frames (ORFs) of certain individual mRNAs exhibited resistance to the inhibition. Nearly all resistant transcripts possess at least one efficiently translated upstream open reading frame (uORF) that represses translation of the main coding ORF under normal conditions. Site-specific mutagenesis of two identified stress resistant mRNAs (PPP1R15B and IFRD1) demonstrated that a single uORF is sufficient for eIF2-mediated translation control in both cases. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that at least two regulatory uORFs (namely, in SLC35A4 and MIEF1) encode functional protein products.",Translation of 5' leaders is pervasive in genes resistant to eIF2 repression.,10.7554/eLife.03971,2015 Jan 26,PMC4383229,eLife

While some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known about how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors that can have dire consequences if uncorrected. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3\' end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. The postdecoding mRNA:rRNA interaction not only contributes to predominant translational pausing, but also provides a retrospective mechanism to safeguard the ribosome in the correct reading frame. Partially eliminating the AUG-like ""sticky"" codons in the reporter message leads to increased +1 frameshift errors. Remarkably, mutating the highly conserved CAU triplet of 18S rRNA globally changes the codon ""stickiness"". Further supporting the role of ""sticky"" sequences in reading frame maintenance, the codon composition of open reading frames is highly optimized across eukaryotic genomes.

It has recently been shown that certain types of cancer cells depend on glycine, glutamine, leucine and serine metabolism to proliferate and survive. In addition, successful therapies using L-asparaginase-induced asparagine deprivation have been developed for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, a tailored detection system for measuring restrictive amino acids in each tumour is currently not available. Here we harness ribosome profiling for sensing restrictive amino acids, and develop diricore, a procedure for differential ribosome measurements of codon reading. We first demonstrate the functionality and constraints of diricore using metabolic inhibitors and nutrient deprivation assays. Notably, treatment with L-asparaginase elicited both specific diricore signals at asparagine codons and high levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS). We then applied diricore to kidney cancer and discover signals indicating restrictive proline. As for asparagine, this observation was linked to high levels of PYCR1, a key enzyme in proline production, suggesting a compensatory mechanism allowing tumour expansion. Indeed, PYCR1 is induced by shortage of proline precursors, and its suppression attenuated kidney cancer cell proliferation when proline was limiting. High PYCR1 is frequently observed in invasive breast carcinoma. In an in vivo model system of this tumour, we also uncover signals indicating restrictive proline. We further show that CRISPR-mediated knockout of PYCR1 impedes tumorigenic growth in this system. Thus, diricore has the potential to reveal unknown amino acid deficiencies, vulnerabilities that can be used to target key metabolic pathways for cancer treatment.",Tumour-specific proline vulnerability uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading.,10.1038/nature16982,2016 Feb 25,,Nature

These changes may restrict the availability of certain amino acids for protein synthesis, which can be utilized for cancer therapy. However, little is known about the amino acid demand changes occurring during aggressive and invasive stages of cancer. Recently, we developed diricore, an approach based on ribosome profiling that can uncover amino acid limitations. Here, we applied diricore to a cellular model in which epithelial breast cells respond rapidly to TGFbeta1, a cytokine essential for cancer progression and metastasis, and uncovered shortage of leucine. Further analyses indicated that TGFbeta1 treatment of human breast epithelial cells reduces the expression of SLC3A2, a subunit of the leucine transporter, which diminishes leucine uptake and inhibits cell proliferation. Thus, we identified a specific amino acid limitation associated with the TGFbeta1 response, a vulnerability that might be associated with aggressiveness in cancer.",TGFbeta1-induced leucine limitation uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading.,10.15252/embr.201744000,2017 Apr,PMC5376977,EMBO reports

Most studies of human PDCD4 have employed tumor cell lines, possibly resulting in a biased picture of its role in normal cells. Here, we have studied the function of PDCD4 in a telomerase-immortalized human epithelial cell line. We show for the first time that PDCD4 is required for the G1/S-transition, demonstrating its crucial role in the cell cycle. Inhibition of p53-dependent activation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) overrides the requirement for PDCD4 for the G1/S-transition, suggesting that PDCD4 counteracts basal p53 activity to prevent activation of the G1/S checkpoint by p53. Transcriptome and ribosome profiling data show that silencing of PDCD4 changes the expression levels and translation of many mRNAs, providing an unbiased view of the cellular processes that are affected by PDCD4 in an epithelial cell line. Our data identify PDCD4 as a key regulator of cell cycle- and DNA-related functions that are inhibited when it is silenced, suggesting that decreased expression of PDCD4 might contribute to tumor development by compromising genomic integrity.",PDCD4 controls the G1/S-phase transition in a telomerase-immortalized epithelial cell line and affects the expression level and translation of multiple mRNAs.,10.1038/s41598-020-59678-w,2020 Feb 17,PMC7026441,Scientific reports

It plays a major role during normal development, differentiation, and disease progression. The modification is regulated by a set of writer, eraser, and reader proteins. The YTH domain family of proteins consists of three homologous m(6)A-binding proteins, Ythdf1, Ythdf2, and Ythdf3, which were suggested to have different cellular functions. However, their sequence similarity and their tendency to bind the same targets suggest that they may have overlapping roles. We systematically knocked out (KO) the Mettl3 writer, each of the Ythdf readers, and the three readers together (triple-KO). We then estimated the effect in vivo in mouse gametogenesis, postnatal viability, and in vitro in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). In gametogenesis, Mettl3-KO severity is increased as the deletion occurs earlier in the process, and Ythdf2 has a dominant role that cannot be compensated by Ythdf1 or Ythdf3, due to differences in readers' expression pattern across different cell types, both in quantity and in spatial location. Knocking out the three readers together and systematically testing viable offspring genotypes revealed a redundancy in the readers' role during early development that is Ythdf1/2/3 gene dosage-dependent. Finally, in mESCs there is compensation between the three Ythdf reader proteins, since the resistance to differentiate and the significant effect on mRNA decay occur only in the triple-KO cells and not in the single KOs. Thus, we suggest a new model for the Ythdf readers function, in which there is profound dosage-dependent redundancy when all three readers are equivalently coexpressed in the same cell types.",Context-dependent functional compensation between Ythdf m(6)A reader proteins.,10.1101/gad.340695.120,2020 Oct 1,PMC7528697,Genes & development

Genome-wide crosslinking and immunoprecipitation of Lso2 and its human ortholog coiled-coil domain containing 124 (CCDC124) recovered 25S ribosomal RNA in a region near the A site that overlaps the GTPase activation center.

Ribosome profiling of yeast lacking LSO2 (lso2Delta) revealed global translation defects during recovery from stationary phase with translation of most genes reduced more than 4-fold. Ribosomes accumulated at start codons, were depleted from stop codons, and showed codon-specific changes in occupancy in lso2Delta. These defects, and the conservation of the specific ribosome-binding activity of Lso2/CCDC124, indicate broadly important functions in translation and physiology.",Lso2 is a conserved ribosome-bound protein required for translational recovery in yeast.,10.1371/journal.pbio.2005903,2018 Sep,PMC6135351,PLoS biology

Lysine methylations on non-histone proteins are also frequent, but in most cases the functional significance of the methylation event, as well as the identity of the responsible lysine (K) specific methyltransferase (KMT), remain unknown. Several recently discovered KMTs belong to the so-called seven-beta-strand (7BS) class of MTases and we have here investigated an uncharacterized human 7BS MTase currently annotated as part of the endothelin converting enzyme 2, but which should be considered a separate enzyme. Combining in vitro enzymology and analyzes of knockout cells, we demonstrate that this MTase efficiently methylates K36 in eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that this novel KMT is named eEF1A-KMT4 (gene name EEF1AKMT4), in agreement with the recently established nomenclature. Furthermore, by ribosome profiling we show that the absence of K36 methylation affects translation dynamics and changes translation speed of distinct codons. Finally, we show that eEF1A-KMT4 is part of a novel family of human KMTs, defined by a shared sequence motif in the active site and we demonstrate the importance of this motif for catalytic activity.",Methylation of human eukaryotic elongation factor alpha (eEF1A) by a member of a novel protein lysine methyltransferase family modulates mRNA translation.,10.1093/nar/gkx432,2017 Aug 21,PMC5737405,Nucleic acids research

To study how this altered transcriptome is translated, we assayed the global distribution of ribosomes in RNase L activated human cells with ribosome profiling.

The functions of SL trans-splicing, however, remain largely enigmatic. RESULTS: We quantified translation genome-wide in the marine chordate, Oikopleura dioica, under inhibition of mTOR, a central growth regulator. Translation of trans-spliced TOP mRNAs was suppressed, consistent with a role of the SL sequence in nutrient-dependent translational control of growth-related mRNAs. Under crowded, nutrient-limiting conditions, O. dioica continued to filter-feed, but arrested growth until favorable conditions returned. Upon release from unfavorable conditions, initial recovery was independent of nutrient-responsive, trans-spliced genes, suggesting animal density sensing as a first trigger for resumption of development. CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with a proposed role of trans-splicing in the coordinated translational down-regulation of nutrient-responsive genes under growth-limiting conditions.",Trans-splicing of mRNAs links gene transcription to translational control regulated by mTOR.,10.1186/s12864-019-6277-x,2019 Nov 29,PMC6883708,BMC genomics

Objectives: The objective of this study was to detect both gene expression levels and alternate RNA splice variants specific for IBC. Methods: W e performed splice-sensitive array profiling using Affymetrix Exon Array and quantitative RT-PCR analyses in 177 IBC compared to 183 non-IBC. We also assessed the prognostic value of the identified candidate genes and splice variants. Results: A 5-splice signature (HSPA8, RPL10, RPL4, DIDO1 and EVL) was able to distinguish IBC from non-IBC tumors (p<10(-7)). This splice signature was associated with poor metastasis-free survival in hormone receptor-negative non-IBC (p=0.02), but had no prognostic value in IBC. PAM analysis of dysregulated genes in IBC compared to non-IBC identified a 10-gene signature highly predictive of IBC phenotype and conferring a poor prognosis in non-IBC. The genes most commonly upregulated in IBC were 3 hemoglobin genes able to reliably discriminate IBC from non-IBC (p<10(-4)). Hb protein expression in epithelial breast tumor cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: IBC has a specific spliced transcript profile and is characterized by hemoglobin gene overexpression that should be investigated in further functional studies.",Hemoglobin overexpression and splice signature as new features of inflammatory breast cancer?,10.1016/j.jare.2020.08.009,2021 Feb,PMC7753232,Journal of advanced research

Looking at additional functional roles for the modification, we find that another m(6)A reader protein, human YTHDF1, actively promotes protein synthesis by interacting with translation machinery. In a unified mechanism of m(6)A-based regulation in the cytoplasm, YTHDF2-mediated degradation controls the lifetime of target transcripts, whereas YTHDF1-mediated translation promotion increases translation efficiency, ensuring effective protein production from dynamic transcripts that are marked by m(6)A.

It has recently been shown that certain types of cancer cells depend on glycine, glutamine, leucine and serine metabolism to proliferate and survive. In addition, successful therapies using L-asparaginase-induced asparagine deprivation have been developed for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, a tailored detection system for measuring restrictive amino acids in each tumour is currently not available. Here we harness ribosome profiling for sensing restrictive amino acids, and develop diricore, a procedure for differential ribosome measurements of codon reading. We first demonstrate the functionality and constraints of diricore using metabolic inhibitors and nutrient deprivation assays. Notably, treatment with L-asparaginase elicited both specific diricore signals at asparagine codons and high levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS). We then applied diricore to kidney cancer and discover signals indicating restrictive proline. As for asparagine, this observation was linked to high levels of PYCR1, a key enzyme in proline production, suggesting a compensatory mechanism allowing tumour expansion. Indeed, PYCR1 is induced by shortage of proline precursors, and its suppression attenuated kidney cancer cell proliferation when proline was limiting. High PYCR1 is frequently observed in invasive breast carcinoma. In an in vivo model system of this tumour, we also uncover signals indicating restrictive proline. We further show that CRISPR-mediated knockout of PYCR1 impedes tumorigenic growth in this system. Thus, diricore has the potential to reveal unknown amino acid deficiencies, vulnerabilities that can be used to target key metabolic pathways for cancer treatment.",Tumour-specific proline vulnerability uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading.,10.1038/nature16982,2016 Feb 25,,Nature

Among them, we identify a small subset of mRNAs responsible for the biogenesis of primary cilium that have been linked to developmental and degenerative diseases, known as ciliopathies, and cancer. We discover that SDOS binds and regulates the translation of several of these mRNAs, controlling cilia development.",Protein Syndesmos is a novel RNA-binding protein that regulates primary cilia formation.,10.1093/nar/gky873,2018 Dec 14,PMC6294507,Nucleic acids research

This is clinically important because this group of patients respond very poorly to treatment. Our approach to discovering novel biomarkers or targets for therapy for p53 deleted/dysfunctional disease is to find genes that are translationally regulated by p53. The aim of this experiment is to compare translational efficiencies in cancer cells that are p53 WT, p53-/-, or p53 R175H, in response to doxorubicin.https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-8100NoneNoneNoneNone{Nature (43.070) doi:10.1038/nature14280}; {Nature (43.070) doi:10.1038/nature14280}; NoneNoneNoneNone[Growth] case control design; ""[1282280] nucleic acid extraction protocol: Cells were lysed and RNA was purified by TRI Reagent (Sigma) and PureLink RNA Micro Kit (Invitrogen).
