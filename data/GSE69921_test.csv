GSE69921,Ribosome profiling of control and leucine-starved SUM159 cells,Homo sapiens,3,SRP059546,2015-06-16,"[Overal design]1 replicate per condition; [Treatment]'For Leucine starvation, cells were cultured in the same medium lacking Leucine for 12 and 24hrs.'; [Growth]'SUM159PT cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 1:1 medium supplemented with 5% FCS, insulin (5 ?g/ml), and hydrocortisone (1ug/ml) in 5% CO2 at 37�C.'; [Extraction]'Approximately 30e6 cells were treated with chloramphenicol (100?g/ml) for 15 minutes and cycloheximide (100?g/ml) for 5 minutes. Cells were lysed in buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100mM KCl, 10mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 2mM DTT, 100 ?g/ml chloramphenicol, 100 ?g/ml cycloheximide, 1x Complete protease inhibitor). Lysates were centrifuged at 5000 rpm and the supernatant was treated with 2U/?l of RNase I (Ambion) for 40 minutes at room temperature. Lysates were fractionated on a linear sucrose gradient (7% - 47%) using the SW- 41Ti rotor at 36,000 rpm for 2hrs. Fractions enriched in mito-monosomes and cytosolic monosomes were identified by western blotting, pooled and treated with proteinase K (Roche) in 1% SDS. Released RPFs were purified using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer�s instructions.\nRNA was gel-purified on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide urea (7 M) gel. A section corresponding to 30-33 nucleotides was excised, eluted and ethanol precipitated. The resulting fragments were 3'-dephosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc. Beverly, MA, USA) for 6 h at 37�C in 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (100 mM MES-NaOH, pH 5.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM ?-mercaptoethanol, 300 mM NaCl). 3' adaptor was added with T4 RNA ligase 1 (New England Biolabs Inc. Beverly, MA, USA) for 2.5 h at 37�C. Ligation products were 5'-phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase for 30 min at 37�C. 5' adaptor was added with T4 RNA ligase 1 for 18 h at 22�C.'; [Cell type]'Source: ''cell line: SUM159; '",Other,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69921,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE69nnn/GSE69921/suppl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA287136,,,,,,,,
