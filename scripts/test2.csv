GSE87328,eIF1 modulates the recognition of sub-optimal translation start sites and steers gene expression control mediated by uORFs,Homo sapiens,6,SRP090415,2016-09-24,"[Overal design]Ribosome profiling and mRNA sequening of human HCT116 cells upon eIF1 knockdown and in control conditions.; [Treatment]'For knockdown experiments, HCT116 cells were transferred to serum-free McCoy�s medium and seeded at a density of 2.4*10E6 cells per 10 cm2 plate. Cells were transfected with either 10nM control si-RNA (si-Ctrl, ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Control siRNAs: D-001810-01-05, Dharmacon, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) or 10nM si-RNAs targeting eIF1 (si-eIF1, SMARTpool: M-015804-01-0005, Dharmacon, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using 63ul of HiPerFect (QIAGEN) per 10 cm2 plate. 5 hours post-transfection, cells were supplemented with FBS at a final concentration (f.c.) of 10%. Overall, 4 x 10 cm2 plates of si-Ctrl and 4 x 10 cm2 plates of si-eIF1 treated HCT116 cells were obtained. Subsequently, 2 plates per condition were incubated with either 50 �M lactimidomycin (LTM) or 100 �g/ml cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma, USA) in a total volume of 5 ml per plate for 30 min at 37�C.'; [Growth]'The human colon cancer HCT116 cells were cultivated in McCoy�s medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.)supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), 2 mM alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide (GlutaMAX, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), 50 units/ml penicillin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and 50 �g/ml streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) in a humidified incubator at 37�C and 5% CO2.'; [Extraction]'Cells were harvested by trypsinitation (Trypsin/EDTA solution, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), collected by centrifugation (5 min at 300g), washed with ice-cold PBS with 100 �g/ml CHX added and recovered again by centrifugation. Cells were re-suspended in 1 ml ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 �g/ml CHX, 1 � complete and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)), lysed by incubation on ice for 10 min and subsequently passed through QIAshredder spin columns (Qiagen). The flow-through was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 � g and 4�C. The supernatant was recovered and protein concentration was measured. For ribosome profiling (ribo-seq), 600 �l of each lysate was subjected to RNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) digestion using 3000 U of enzyme for every 7 mg protein. Digestion of polysomes proceeded for 45 min at room temperature  and was stopped with SUPERase.In RNase Inhibitor (Life Technologies). Next, monosomes were recovered by ultracentrifugation at 75,000 RPM in a cooled TLA-120.2 rotor over a 1 M sucrose cushion in 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, 100 �g/ml CHX and 100 U/ml Superase.In. RNA was extracted from the samples using a heated acid phenol; chloroform; isoamyl alcohol (125:24:1) procedure.\nFor ribo-seq, ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) of 26-34 nucleotides were extracted from 22 �g of RNA subjected to electrophoresis under denaturing conditions in 15% TBE-Urea polyacrylamide gel (Life Technologies). Extraction from gel was performed in RNase-free water for 10 min at 70�C and precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, 1.5 �l GlycoBlue (Life Technologies) and 1 volume of isopropanol overnight at ? 80 �C. Following a dephosphorylation reaction (end-repair) with 10 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), the RPFs were ligated to a 1.5 �g of Universal cloning linker using 200 U of T4 RNA ligase II (both New England Biolabs). The ligated product was size-selected using denaturing gel electrophoresis and purified from gel as described above. Subsequently, reverse transcription (RT) was performed with 200 U of SuperScript III (Life Technologies) according to (Ingolia et al, 2011), followed by a size-selection of the RT product (described above). Ribosomal RNA derived contaminants were depleted from reverse transcribed samples using a custom set of 20 biotynylated deoxyoligonucleotides. 100 pmol of mixed probes with 60ul MyOne Streptavidin C1 DynaBeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) were used each time. Next, samples were subjected to circular ligation using 100 U of CircLigase (Illumina), diluted and amplified by PCR using Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs) for 12 cycles of denaturation (10 s at 98�C), annealing (10 s of 65�C) and elongation (5 s at 72�C) using primer pairs compatible with the Illumina sequencing platform. The resulting ribosome-profiling libraries were duplexed (samples treated with the same inhibitor, LTM or CHX, were joined).', 'For mRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), total RNA was isolated from 400ul cell lysate with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) according to manufacturer�s instructions. RNA quality was assessed by Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA 600 Nano Kit and RIN values above 9 were accepted.\nFor mRNA-seq, rRNA depletion with Ribo-Zero probes, random fragmentation, cDNA synthesis and library generation were performed according to TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation protocol (Illumina). mRNA-seq and ribo-seq libraries were subjected to sequencing on a NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina) to yield 75 bp single-end reads.'; [Cell type]'Source: ''tissue: colon; cell line: HCT116; phenotype: colorectal carcinoma; '",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87328,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE87nnn/GSE87328/suppl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA344393,28541577," Daria Fijalkowska,  Steven Verbruggen,  Elvis Ndah,  Veronique Jonckheere,  Gerben Menschaert,  Petra Van Damme","Alternative translation initiation mechanisms such as leaky scanning and reinitiation potentiate the polycistronic nature of human transcripts. By allowing for reprogrammed translation, these mechanisms can mediate biological responses to stimuli. We combined proteomics with ribosome profiling and mRNA sequencing to identify the biological targets of translation control triggered by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 (eIF1), a protein implicated in the stringency of start codon selection. We quantified expression changes of over 4000 proteins and 10 000 actively translated transcripts, leading to the identification of 245 transcripts undergoing translational control mediated by upstream open reading frames (uORFs) upon eIF1 deprivation. Here, the stringency of start codon selection and preference for an optimal nucleotide context were largely diminished leading to translational upregulation of uORFs with suboptimal start. Interestingly, genes affected by eIF1 deprivation were implicated in energy production and sensing of metabolic stress.",eIF1 modulates the recognition of suboptimal translation initiation sites and steers gene expression via uORFs.,10.1093/nar/gkx469,2017 Jul 27,PMC5570006,Nucleic acids research
