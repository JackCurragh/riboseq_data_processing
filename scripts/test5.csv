GSE53187,Transcriptome and translatome profiling of CPX 24h effects in neuroblastoma cells CHP134,Homo sapiens,12,None,2013-12-10,"[Overal design]Microarray analysis was performed to enable a comprehensive view of the changes in the transcriptional and translational status of the cells in response to the treatment with an iron chelator CPX. Polysomal RNA and total RNA were isolated from vehicle-treated CHP134 cells and CHP134 cells treated with 5 �M CPX for 24 hours. Each condition is represented by three biological replicates, i.e. the experiment was repeated starting each time from cells seeding yielding an independent RNA sample. In total, 12 samples corresponding to 4 conditions were subjected to microarray analysis.; [Treatment]'CHP134 cells growing in 10 cm cell culture dishes were treated with vehicle for 24 hours.', 'CHP134 cells growing in 10 cm cell culture dishes were treated with 5 �M CPX for 24 hours.'; [Growth]'CHP134 cells were purchased from ECACC (Cat. No. 06122002). The cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM glutamine at 37 �C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2.'; [Extraction]'To extract polysomal RNA, the following procedure was applied. CHP134 cells were incubated with 100 ?g/ml cycloheximide for 4 minutes, rinsed with phosphate buffer saline and lysed directly in cell-culture vessels [10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris�HCl, pH 7.5, 1 % Triton X-100, 1 % sodium deoxycholate, 100 ?g/ml cycloheximide, 0.2 U/?l RNase inhibitor, 1 mM DTT]. The lysate was collected with a cell scraper, pipetted into a microcentrifuge tube and after 5 minutes incubation on ice centrifuged for 10 min at 12000 g at 4 �C. The supernatant was transferred into a new microcentrifuge tube and stored at �80 �C. The lysates were fractionated by ultracentrifugation (Sorvall rotor, 100 min at 180000 g) through 15�50 % linear sucrose gradient containing 30 mM Tris�HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2.  Polysomal fractions were collected monitoring the absorbance at 254 nm. Polysomal RNA was isolated after proteinase K treatment, phenol�chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation and finally resuspended in 50 ?l of water. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer platform.', 'Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen) following the instructions of the supplier and eluted in 50 ?l of water.'; [Cell type]'Source: ''disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): vehicle; rna fraction: polysomal RNA; biological replicate: #1; ', 'disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): CPX; rna fraction: polysomal RNA; biological replicate: #1; ', 'disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): vehicle; rna fraction: total RNA; biological replicate: #1; ', 'disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): CPX; rna fraction: total RNA; biological replicate: #1; ', 'disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): vehicle; rna fraction: total RNA; biological replicate: #2; ', 'disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): CPX; rna fraction: total RNA; biological replicate: #2; ', 'disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): vehicle; rna fraction: polysomal RNA; biological replicate: #2; ', 'disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): CPX; rna fraction: polysomal RNA; biological replicate: #2; ', 'disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): vehicle; rna fraction: polysomal RNA; biological replicate: #3; ', 'disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): CPX; rna fraction: polysomal RNA; biological replicate: #3; ', 'disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): vehicle; rna fraction: total RNA; biological replicate: #3; ', 'disease: neuroblastoma; cell line: CHP134; agent (compound): CPX; rna fraction: total RNA; biological replicate: #3; '",Expression profiling by array,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE53187,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE53nnn/GSE53187/suppl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA231066,,,,,,,,
